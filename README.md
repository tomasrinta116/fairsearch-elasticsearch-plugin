# Fair search algorithms for Elasticsearch

The Fair Search Elasticsearch plugin uses machine learning to provide a fair search result with relevant protected 
and non protected classes. 

# What this plugin does...

This plugin:

- Store fairness distribution tables to be used during rescoring.
- Allows you to rescore fairly any query in Еlasticsearch.

## Where's the docs?

We recommend taking time to [read the docs](http://fairsearch-elasticsearch.readthedocs.io). 

## How to contribute?

This plugin is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from the community — you! All contributions are welcome: ideas, patches, documentation, bug reports, complaints, and even something you drew up on a napkin.

Programming is not a required skill. Whatever you've seen about open source and maintainers or community members saying "send patches or die" - you will not see that here.

It is more important to me that you are able to contribute.

# Installing

### Install Elasticsearch
First intall [Elasticsearch Version 6.2.4](https://www.elastic.co/de/downloads/past-releases/elasticsearch-6-2-4).
To install the fairsearch plugin you can run 

`./bin/elasticsearch-plugin install https://fair-search.github.io/fair-reranker/fairsearch-1.0-es6.2.4-SNAPSHOT.zip`
(It's expected you'll confirm some security exceptions, you can pass `-b` to `elasticsearch-plugin` to automatically install)

or if you have made changes to the plugin you can run 

```
./gradlew clean check
```
and then install your build with the following command

```
./bin/elasticsearch-plugin install file:///path/to/project/build/distributions/fairsearch-1.0.0-es6.2.2.zip
```

See the full list of [prebuilt versions](https://fair-search.github.io/). If you don't see a version available, see the link below for building.

# Development

Notes if you want to dig into the code or build for a version there's no build for.

### 1. Build with Gradle Wrapper

```
./gradlew clean check
```

This runs the tasks in the `esplugin` gradle plugin that builds, tests, generates a Elasticsearch plugin zip file.

# How to use the Plugin
Once you have a running Elasticsearch node with the fairsearch plugin installed you can perform search queries and get the results in a fair ordering according to the [FA*IR: A Fair Top-k Ranking Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06368).


### Get a Fair Ranking

In order to use the plugin we need to make a Elasticsearch query with a re-scorer. Here is a sample query:

```
POST http://yourESNodeAdress/indexName/_search

{
	"from" : 0, "size" : 25,
	"query" : {
		"match" : {
			"body" : "hello"
			}
		},
	"rescore" : {
		"window_size" : 25,
		"fair_rescorer" : {
			"protected_key" : "gender",
			"protected_value" : "f",
			"significance_level" : 0.1,
			"min_proportion_protected" : 0.5
			}
		}
}
```

The parameters used in the query are the following:

- `size/window_size` is the length of the (re)ranking
- `min_proportion_protected` is the desired proportion of candidates with a protected attribute
- `significance_level` is the significance level
- `protected_key` specifies which attribute of the store document keeps the key which divides the documents in to protected or not protected
- `protected_value` specifies the value in the protected_key which tells when a document is protected

We recommend reading [FA*IR: A Fair Top-k Ranking Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06368) in order to understand why we need these parameters.

### Manually create a MTable

An M table is a representation for a fair ranking. The plugin also allows us to create a M table manually with following call:

```
POST http://yourESNodeAdress/_fs/_mtable/0.5/0.1/25
```
The M table is now stored in your Elasticsearch node. To get a list of all M tables in your node you can make the following request:

```
GET http://yourESNodeAdress/_fs/_mtable
```
