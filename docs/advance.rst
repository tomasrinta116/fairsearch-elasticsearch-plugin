Building M tables
-----------------

The M tables are a core component of this plugin. They indicate at position *M[i]* the minimum number of protected elements that must be present among the top *i* elements to consider the ranking was fair.

In the plugin we operationalize this process by creating them inside elasticsearch as documents in their own internal store,
otherwise the process of calculating them on every request would it be very costly.

Create a new M table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a new M table you can issue the next command:

    POST _fs/_mtable/{proportion}/{alpha}/{k}

where the parameters are:

* proportion: The proportion of protected elements.
* alpha: The significance parameter (Î±) corresponding to the probability of rejecting a fair ranking.
* k: The expected size of returned documents in the search.


for example:

    POST /_fs/_mtable/0.5/0.1/5

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "_index": ".fs_store",
        "_type": "store",
        "_id": "name(0.5,0.1,5)",
        "_version": 1,
        "result": "created",
        "forced_refresh": true,
        "_shards": {
            "total": 2,
            "successful": 1,
            "failed": 0
        },
        "_seq_no": 0,
        "_primary_term": 1
    }

this will store a document in elasticsearch that will look like:

.. code-block:: json

      {
        "_index": ".fs_store",
        "_type": "store",
        "_id": "name(0.5,0.1,5)",
        "_score": 1,
        "_source": {
          "type": "mtable",
          "proportion": 0.5,
          "alpha": 0.1,
          "k": 5,
          "mtable": [
            0,
            0,
            0,
            0,
            1,
            1
          ]
        }
      }

List all stored M tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To list all stored M tables you can use this command:

    GET _fs/_mtable

this will give you an answer like:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "took": 7,
        "timed_out": false,
        "_shards": {
        "total": 5,
        "successful": 5,
        "skipped": 0,
        "failed": 0
    },
    "hits": {
        "total": 3,
        "max_score": 1,
        "hits": [
        {
            "_index": ".fs_store",
            "_type": "store",
            "_id": "name(0.5,0.1,5)",
            "_score": 1,
            "_source": {
                "type": "mtable",
                "proportion": 0.5,
                "alpha": 0.1,
                "k": 5,
                "mtable": [
                 0,
                 0,
                 0,
                 0,
                 1,
                 1
                 ]
            }
        },
    ....
        ]
        }
    }


Delete stored M tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently there is no functionality offered to delete an specific mtable, you should probably also never do that yourself.
However if you want to delete documents, use the standard document api from elastic and refer to the specific table
document id.
