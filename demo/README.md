# Demo Application

This is a step-by-step tutorial to set up and run a Demo-Application of Elasticsearch with the FA*IR-search plugin on your local machine.
We highly recommend to read [FA*IR: A Fair Top-k Ranking Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06368) before you go through this tutorial since we will not explain the theory behind the plugin in this tutorial.

The demo consists of a html frontend, a node.js server which handles the requests from the frontend and sends the processed queries to an elasticsearch node with the fairsearch plugin.
