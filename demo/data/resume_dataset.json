Simply listing duties or responsibilities from your job description are not enough focus on what you actually did and how your efforts impacted your position, the project, or organization. To help get you in the mindset of writing result and accomplishment statements, ask yourself some of these questions: What was the purpose of this work? How was this work relevant to the organization? What goals was I contributing to? What value or benefit did I add? How did I go above and beyond basic job duties? Compared to others in my position, how did I stand out? Did this work save time/money, increase customer satisfaction, design/improve a process or policy, etc? Did I achieve more with less; complete something ahead of schedule/budget? Did I receive a promotion and/or recognition during my employment? Did I consistently maintain or hit above personal or company goals or quotas? NOTE: THE FOLLOWING SAMPLES ARE FOR REFERENCE PURPOSES ONLY DO NOT COPY. You can develop result and accomplishment statements using several methods, which are described below: SOAR Statement of Action What did you do? (Action verb) Occurrence of Action How often action occurred/took place (daily, weekly, annually, etc.) Amount of Action How much, how many? (20%, 50+, over 100, $1M, etc.) Result of Action Result/outcome of efforts (increased, decreased, designed, saved, implemented, etc.) Statement Managed a technical crew Occurrence Managed a technical crew on a daily basis Amount Managed a technical crew of over 20 people on a daily basis Result Managed a technical crew of over 20 people, on a daily basis, that increased production 3 quarters in a row PAR/CAR Problem/Challenge Problem/challenge/opportunity Action Action taken to solve the problem Result Result or outcome of your efforts STAR Situation/Task Situation or task at hand Action Action taken Result Result of action taken ADDITIONAL RESULT/ACCOMPLISHMENT STATEMENT EXAMPLES: Selected as Freshman Orientation Leader; acclimated 150 new students to college environment through guided tours of campus and presentations over a 3-day period.

TRANSFERABLE SKILLS You have obtained many skills throughout your life: working, being a student, participating in extracurricular activities, and even personal experiences have all contributed to your skill set. Skills which can apply to many different jobs or areas are called transferable skills. They are especially handy to use if you have no relevant work experience or if you are changing career paths. Incorporating these into your work experience section will help showcase the applicable skills you have to offer the employer. Remember, simply listing that you have these skills is not enough. You must include how you used these skills in order to prove you possess them, and show how they are relevant and applicable to the employer. Below is a list of transferable skills to help you get started. Communication Speaking effectively Listening attentively Writing concisely Editing Providing appropriate feedback Perceiving nonverbal messages Facilitating group discussion Expressing ideas Negotiating and persuading Speaking a foreign language Reporting information Describing feelings Research and Planning Creating ideas Setting goals Forecasting Analyzing Extracting information Identifying resources Developing strategies Predicting outcomes Gathering information Synthesizing data Solving problems Defining needs Human Relations Developing rapport Being sensitive Counseling Asserting Perceiving feelings and situations Providing support for others Delegating with respect Conveying feelings Representing others Cooperating Motivating Listening Organization, Management, and Leadership Initiating new ideas Decision making with others Managing groups Delegating responsibility Managing conflict Selling ideas or products Coaching Handling details Coordinating tasks Promoting change Counseling Teaching Work Survival Being punctual Meeting goals Cooperating Organizing Attending to detail Enforcing policies Making decisions Enlisting help Setting and meeting deadlines Implementing decisions Accepting responsibility Managing time TRANSFERABLE SKILLS: SAMPLES Here are some examples of how to use transferable skills to improve on basic job descriptions and prove to the employer that you possess relevant job-related skills.

Bolded words are especially good for describing accomplishments.

What one person likes, another may not. Ask for a lot of input before deciding on the r sum that is right for you. Keep it to one page unless you have significant experience in your field. If you do have a two page r sum , make sure they are two relatively complete pages. If you will be moving soon, use the two-address format. Keep typeface simple. It s best to use Times-Roman or Arial. 8 1/2x 11white or light colored, good quality paper is best. Avoid flashy look at me colors. Use matching paper for cover letter and avoid folding your r sum into a mailing envelope. Send it in a 9x 11mailing envelope. Justify the left margin, but not the right. It s easier to read. Highlight important information (your name, address, and titles of jobs, major categories) with boldface type. Use 11 or 12-point type. Do not use graphics unless you are in the design field. Save it on a computer disk. It s easier to update and/or change this way. Keep the disk safe, and make a back-up copy. Saving your r sum also lets you make targeted r sum s for specific positions to which you are applying. Everything you put in your r sum is fair game for the interview. Be able to discuss every point without having to refer to notes or ask for time to respond to a question. Bring extra r sum s to your interview; even if you are sure your interviewer has a copy. Use action words (see page 20) when describing what you have done. Examples include: created, managed, developed, revised, presented, etc. Proof. Proof. Proof. One mistake generally means you re out the door. The quality of your r sum reflects the quality of your work and professionalism. If you make a mistake on your r sum , will you make a mistake in your job? Employers will think so. Remember the 3-Example Rule: If you list a skill, you need to come up with three examples to support it. Highlight computer/technology knowledge and skills as well as experience working as part of a group or team. 11 12 Parts of the R sum Identification This section should include your name, address, telephone numbers (home, and/or cell phone numbers), and e-mail address. Make sure the employer can reach you, or can leave a message easily. Tips Include area codes with all telephone numbers Make sure your voice mail message or e-mail address is not offensive, unprofessional or cutesy Examples of UNPROFESSIONAL emails: Studmuffin@aol.com emilyscarletohara@hotmail.com sexychick@yahoo.com Objective The objective should tell what you can contribute and demonstrate the value you will add to the organization. The r sum material following the objective should support or prove that you can perform the objective. If you have access to a computer, you can easily change your job objective to suit each employment opportunity. Having an objective is OPTIONAL. If you choose not to use an objective, make sure you refer to the job you are targeting in your cover letter. Sample Strong Objectives A position as a General Sales Representative with Eli Lilly which will utilize my chemistry and sales background. A position in data analysis where skills in mathematics, computer programming, and deductive reasoning will contribute to new systems development. Sample of Weak Objectives Management position which will use my business administration degree and will provide opportunities for rapid advancement and annual salary increases. A public relations position in which I can maximize opportunities to develop and implement programs, organize people and events, communicate positive ideas and images. 13 Tips The objective should be as short as possible, and not include such phrases as challenging position , utilizing my skills , growth potential , room for advancement , etc. If you are applying for a specific job opening, always use the employer s job title for that position. If you choose not to use an objective, use a summary statement or qualifications section instead. Showcasing There are two sections of a r sum that are optional, but are excellent ways to showcase your abilities up front. Think of them as a quick snapshot of your best talents. This helps the employer get interested in you quickly! Summary Statement When you have a number of years experience in a particular field or industry, this statement is often used as an alternative to an objective or as an addition. It portrays a summary of your credentials in sentence or paragraph form. Example Over ten years of successful experience providing professional customer service. Proven ability to effectively handle difficult situations. Highly motivated, energetic and very creative. Qualifications This section often appears on the r sum to highlight and summarize your areas of expertise, and your credentials, usually including 3 5 lines making reference to your Work History, Education and Strengths or Self Management Skills. Examples Recently completed my BS degree in Mechanical Engineering Programming experience in Java, CTT and HTML Fluent in Spanish and Russian Tips Put strong statements at the beginning of your r sum . The most important information should come first. Don t use the word I in any part of your resume. 14 Worksheet: Showcase Your Accomplishments Showcasing your abilities can a challenge, because most of us don t brag on a daily basis. However, to successfully communicate your skills to the employer, you need to learn how to sell yourself. Take some time to list your accomplishments. Start now, but come back to it later, when you ve thought of more things. Draw on all your experiences: paid, unpaid, volunteer, and home. Once you have a list you can pick and choose what you want to highlight. There is no right or wrong way to do this, but try to include as much information as possible. If you trained people, how many? The employer doesn t know your capabilities, so your job is to educate him/her on what you can bring to the position! Examples Successfully managed $500,000 accounts receivables and reduced delinquent accounts by 15 percent. Trained over 100 staff members in CPR and First Aid procedures. Developed 35 new accounts while maintaining 60 existing accounts. Accomplishments Keep in mind the variety of experiences you have had which can transfer to other job duties.

She brought deep and broad senior-level UX skillsets to each project, as well as an intimate knowledge as to the technical feasibility of what was being designed due to her hardcore background as a developer, too. We worked together on projects that spanned extremely creative/edgy/marketing-focused to complex, interaction-based web-based apps for the general public (the largest credit card company in the world).

Jensen Project Justification Page 2 of 2 Looking at Bradley s achievements, it s hard to believe his phone wasn t ringing off the hook. But his original r sum was a five-page data dump that made the reader really work to figure how what he d done. Part of his problem was that he was good at just about every aspect of senior management, so defining a brand and honing in on the most relevant achievements was a challenge. I embraced his multiple talents as assets and positioned him a leader who delivers bottom-line growth by improving every aspect of business from Sales to Operations to HR. I built a branding statement and brief introductory profile to set the expectations of the reader accordingly. Rather than trying to include all of his accomplishments, I honed in on representative projects from each of his areas of strength, creating mini case studies that provide insight into Bradley s management style and proof of his effectiveness. One of his accomplishments, saving $30M per year in delivery model operations, became a simple graph that tells an immediate story to the reader. I wanted to take advantage of Bradley s stellar early career performance as an executive at a major bank without risking age discrimination. So I created an Early Career Summary without dates. Bradley s new resume generated a lot of interest. He landed a General Manager position within three months at a premier HR services firm.", "gender": "f"}},

A resume is a one or two page (at most) summary of your skills, accomplishments, experiences and education designed to capture a prospective employer interest. The resume is also a great way to capture and organize, neatly and concisely, your skills and experience which will be very useful when it comes time to interview. The resume is the primary tool of your job search and may take several drafts to prepare effectively. Resumes must do their work quickly. Employers or Human Resources personnel may look through hundreds of resumes for a particular position and may spend only a few seconds reviewing each. To get someone to look at it longer, your resume must convey quickly that you are capable and competent enough to be worth an interview. Employers use this tool to screen potential candidates before granting interviews, so the goal is to use the resume to entice the employer to want to meet you. The more thoroughly you prepare your resume now, the more likely someone is to read it later. COMPONENTS OF A RESUME There are four basic styles of resumes: REVERSE-CHRONOLOGICAL Also called simply Chronological, this is the most common resume format. It s also the simplest to create. Education and Experience are each listed by category, in reverse-chronological (most recent first) order. The chronological resume is usually best for undergraduates and entry-level candidates. This handout will focus primarily on the chronological resume format. FUNCTIONAL (experience sorted by relevance to career objective) A functional resume differs from a chronological resume by concentrating on skills that you have used that relate to your stated objective rather than on the jobs you have had. A functional resume is particularly effective if your work experience has not been closely related to your job objective, if you are changing careers, or if you are seeking a promotion. In this format you elaborate on the skills necessary to perform the desired job and how you have demonstrated those same skills in different types of jobs. Because the Functional Resume is not recommended for most entry-level candidates, it will not be described in detail in this handout. COMBINATION The combination chronological/functional resume uses elements of both styles. The qualifications (areas of effectiveness) of the functional resume remain within specific job/experience descriptions. The jobs/experiences are then grouped and categorized to show the strengths in two to four categories. This resume format is effective if at least some of your experience is related to the job objective, and also when the job objective has more than one component and you have experience in these different components (e.g., technical and management; sales and organizational). Because the Combination Resume is not recommended for most entry-level candidates, it will not be described in detail in this handout. CURRICULUM VITAE Also called a CV, this is a highly specialized resume format used by those individuals seeking a teaching and/or research position in a postsecondary institution or high-level research industry. Information in all categories should be in reverse chronological order (the most recent data first). 3 Creating your Chronological Resume: I. Header Your contact information Your name should be the biggest item on the page and be on its own line Use an address where you can receive correspondence Supply the phone number whose line offers you the most privacy for you to speak professionally on (ensure you have a PROFESSIONAL greeting on your answering machine) Include your e-mail address DO NOT list your age, gender, religion, political affiliation, marital status, health status or social security number II. Objective A clear and concise statement that can communicate the following: The position or field you desire and your long term goals The position or field you are pursuing and the skills you wish to use The position or field you desire and the responsibilities you are seeking REMEMBER a poor objective can hurt a resume. Be sure NOT to use vague, general statements (e.g, Electrical engineering graduate looking to apply leadership and technical skills to a challenging position with potential for growth. ) III. Education Where you can indicate your educational and academic background Name of Institution, City, State Type of degree: Bachelor of Science, Master of Science, Ph.D. Date of graduation or anticipated graduation date Additional Sub-headings under Education could be: Academic Projects: especially Senior Design Project which can be a separate sub-heading Related Coursework: 4-6 courses that relate to the employer and/or position, no more than 8 Honors: Deans List, with semesters, Honor Societies, Scholarships, Awards, Academic Honors, etc. Optional information could be: GPA if 3.0 or above (general rule of thumb, if GPA is not above a 3.0, do not include it) Fundamentals of Engineering Exam can be phrased: Certified Engineer-in-Training, Date once you ve passed Hours worked to finance ___% of your education Any relevant seminars or workshops you ve attended IV. Experience Information that should be included: Name of company Location of company, city, state Dates of employment Job Titles and if applicable, department Provide a brief job description (bulleted list or short paragraph), using appropriate action verbs that emphasize your strengths. Make sure you use the proper verb tense. o Focus on your significant achievements and contributions o Focus on how you saved the employer time and money o QUANTIFY your accomplishments whenever possible For example: Project scheduled for 49 days completed in 27 and Software enhancements cut required purchase processing time by 38 percent If applicable, you can divide your work experience into two categories: Experience (or Related Experience ) and Additional Experience (or Other Experience ). 4 V. Skills There are three different skill sets that can be listed as sub-headings under Skills or be their own main heading. Computer Skills: List ALL computer skills in some type of order Language Skills: If need be, you can break these out into Fluent in and Conversational in Lab Skills VI. Activities/Affiliations List any memberships or affiliations you have, indicating any offices held and achievements related to these activities. Membership in an engineering society, honor societies, student organizations, etc. VII. Interests (not essential) This section is used to show that you are a well-rounded individual. List any hobbies or interests that you feel might add spice to your profile. Make sure that the information you provide is appropriate and useful. VIII. Other Possible Section Headings Citizenship Military Experience Publications and/or Patents held or pending Volunteer/Community Activities THE GLANCE TEST To make sure your resume looks flawless and noticeable, you want to make sure that your resume will pass the glance test. You should ask yourself these questions when preparing for the glance test: Is your format consistent throughout the resume? o If you use periods, use periods throughout. o Use the same bullets throughout. o If indenting, indent the same amount each time. o Make sure top and bottom margins are equal and right and left margins are equal. o Use standard typefaces such as Arial, Helvetica, Universe, Times, Palatino, Century, and Courier. o Use a font size of 10 to 14 points. (Avoid Times New Roman 10 point). o Avoid fancy treatments such as italics, underline, shadows, and reverse (white letters on black background). o Avoid vertical and horizontal lines, graphics, and boxes. o Avoid two-column format or resumes that look like newspapers or newsletters. o List each phone number and e-mail on its own line. Do you have too much or not enough white space? o You want to make sure that you format the resume so that the white space is kept to a minimum, while not overwhelming the reader with too much text. Does your resume look symmetrical? Have you SPELL-CHECKED? There is NO excuse for a misspelled word and recruiters may view it as laziness Are you utilizing action verbs? (A list of actions verbs can be found on page 7) Have you proofread? Once you ve answered these questions to your satisfaction and corrected any problems found, proceed with the glance test. Hold your resume in front of you for ten seconds does it look good, are you satisfied with your work? 5 OTHER MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION YOU SHOULD KNOW When writing numbers, numbers one ten should be spelled out, numbers 11, 12, 13, 14 can be written using the number symbol. When describing your past experience, use verbs written in the past tense (Designed). When describing your present experience, use present-tense verbs (Design). WHAT NOT TO PUT ON A RESUME There are certain pieces of information that you should never include on your resume. These include: Your social security number. Who knows who s hands your resume could fall into? Identity theft is a very real problem, and they don t need your SSN until after you ve been hired, anyway. Personal information that could be used to discriminate against you. An employer doesn t need to know your age, race, religion, gender, marital status, whether or not you have kids, your nation of origin, your weight, your height, your sexual orientation, or your politics. None of that has anything to do with your ability to carry out the requirements of the job. It s illegal for employers to even ask you for that information while you re applying, so you shouldn t volunteer the information. References. The only person who s name should be on your resume is yourself. It s good to have references that you can give to an employer when they ask, but they should always be on a separate document, which you give to the employer only after they ve asked. It s common to conclude a resume with References Available Upon Request, and there s nothing wrong with including that if you have room, but it s generally assumed by most employers that you can provide references when asked. Anything negative. Did you get fired from a previous job? Did you get laid off because your boss ran the company into the ground? Do you hate eating your vegetables? Whatever it is, keep it to yourself. You don t want to look like a complainer, and you certainly don t want to look like a backstabber. Only provide positive information about yourself, and never badmouth a previous employer, even if working for them was the worst experience of your entire life. First person pronouns. Using words like I, me, my, etc, just doesn t look very professional. Avoid them, which should be easier if you re making an effort to start sentences with verbs. The only place it s appropriate to use a first person pronoun is in your Objective statement or possibly referring to we on a group project, but try to avoid it. Your picture. You re applying for a professional position, not auditioning for a TV show. They don t need a headshot. RECRUITERS TOP 10 RESUME PET PEEVES Recently, ResumeDoctor.com1 asked more than 2,500 recruiters from a variety of industries what their pet peeves were when it comes to resumes: 1.) Spelling Errors, Typos and Poor Grammar make sure you spell-check AND proofread 2.) Too Duty-Oriented don t just write the company s summary of your position, explain your accomplishments 3.) Inaccurate Dates or None at All this missing or inaccurate information could send up red flags 4.) Inaccurate or Missing Contact Information if a recruiter can t reach you they will move on to someone else 5.) Poor Formatting 6.) Functional Resumes 7.) Long Resumes too much information will simply waste a recruiter s time 8.) Long Paragraphs stay focused and concise 9.) Unqualified Candidates 10.) Personal Information Unrelated to the Job 6 ACTION VERBS Good use of action verbs can mean the difference when it comes to getting your foot in the door and being invited for an interview. Remember, a hiring manager probably sees dozens of resumes for each position they re trying to fill, each with a similar list of skills and experience. The key is to make sure yours gets noticed. When describing experience, try to start each sentence with an action verb. Don t use the same verb repeatedly, and don t limit yourself to this list.

Configuration management Windows 7, Linux, preempt_rt patch C, Trace32, shell script Visual Studio, Vim, Trace32 Debugging Tool, SVN, TFS, gdb, eldk cross-compilers In case of propriety RTOS like vxWorks a large amount of time and money had to be invested in terms of both development and licensing cost. Also much time was required to port ABB applications to APIs that were not completely POSIX compliant and it increased the reliance on single vendor. All these problems could be overcome by using an open source OS like linux while still maintaining the real time constraints using preempt_rt patch. This was a research project that studied the properties of preempt_rt patched Linux in real world scenarios and decided on worst case timings that will satisfy requirements in ABB s robotic applications Project Name Role Client Duration Work Location Description Description CCPU Software Developer NOATM July 2009 Bangalore This project involved putting realtime embedded Linux on the MPC5200 based CCPU board.

Such porting does not provide any value addition to ABB robotics and yet increases time to market.

It includes sample resumes, as well as best practices and helpful resources for developing a successful document. DePaul University s Peer Career Advisors are available on a walk-in basis to assist you with creating and/or improving your resume. Inquire about Peer Career Advisor Program hours by calling the Career Center at (312) 362-8437 (Loop Campus) or (773) 325-7431 (Lincoln Park Campus). Contents I. Resume Purpose, Design, & Mechanics .. ..Page 3 II. Key Elements of a Successful Resumes . ....Page 4 This document is intended to guide you in creating your resume by outlining important types of information to include and tips for doing so in a professional and persuasive manner. Please note this is not intended as a template and the format employed may or may not best represent you. Consider meeting with a Peer Career Advisor to discuss how you might best layout your own resume. III. Transferable Skills & Action Verbs .Page 5 Transferable skills are those that can be applied in a variety of industries and job functions. Considering which transferable skills you want to convey to employers is a great place to start when composing your resume. This list is a sampling of the types of skills you might highlight on your resume, in addition to those skills that are more specific to your major, intended industry, or job function. A sampling of action verbs is also included on this page. Be sure to use strong action verbs to begin each of your bulleted statements, previewing the skill to be exemplified through the accomplishment statement. IV. Chronological Resume Samples... ...Pages 6-11 In this most commonly accepted resume format, job titles and employers are emphasized, starting with your most recent experiences to illustrate a progressive work history. Your skills and accomplishments are described through bulleted statements under each position. This resume type is recommended for people who have recently graduated with a bachelor s degree, those who are staying within the same career field, and candidates with few time gaps in their job history. This type is most often preferred by employers because it is easy to scan, highlights job titles, employers, and dates, and clearly ties candidates skills and accomplishments to their work histories. V. Functional & Combination Resume Samples... ..Pages 12-13 This format is an option for candidates who have changed employers frequently, have gaps in their employment history, or are hoping to transition to a new industry or unrelated job function. Functional resumes enable candidates to highlight transferable skills, placing less emphasis on employment dates, job titles, and employers. VI. Additional Career Center Resume Resources ...Page 14 2 I. Resume Purpose, Design, & Mechanics The purpose of a resume is to market yourself to employers by succinctly summarizing your education, experience, and skills, ultimately aiming to convince employers to invite you to interview. When conceptualizing your resume, think of it as a marketing tool, rather than a simple work history, as it is intended to promote you as the perfect candidate for the opportunity at hand. Resume writing is an art, not a science. There is no one correct way to formulate a resume, but there are some best practices and standards that the Career Center recommends. Stand out from the crowd with high quality content and a clearly written, error-free document. Sequence the information from most important to least important with regard to your career objective. When constructing bullet points, aim to highlight accomplishments that exemplify the skills you possess and employers are seeking. Length: With a few rare exceptions, when applying for internships or entry-level jobs, students should keep their resume to 1 page. If you have difficulty narrowing down your resume, consider removing elements that are not closely related to the opportunities for which you are applying. Margins: Make your resume visually attractive. Use some whitespace to allow the reader s eye to rest. Using .5 inch to 1.5 inch margins is recommended. Font: Use a font that is easy to read. Times New Roman, Arial, and Courier New are good choices. A 10-12 point font size is recommended. Consistency: Keep the formatting consistent throughout your resume. For example, if you choose to bold a job title, make sure you bold every job title. Also, make sure that all of your bullet points, section headers, dates, etc. line up neatly on the page. Accuracy: Your resume, and all other job search materials, must be 100% error free. Be sure to carefully read through your resume, checking grammar, spelling, and punctuation. It is a good idea to have at least 2-3 people proofread it as well. Be Accomplishment-Orientated: Employers hire you for your skills and want to read about times when you have successfully utilized the skills they are seeking. Describe achievements, rather than listing duties, quantify outcomes whenever possible, and be sure to highlight your proficiency in both technical (industry or job function-specific) and transferable skills. Use Action Verbs: Strengthen your bullet points by beginning each with an action verb that previews the skill to be exemplified in that accomplishment statement. This allows a potential employer to more easily scan your resume for what he or she is seeking. Make it Clear and Be Succinct: Eliminate the pronoun I at the beginning of each bullet point as this is assumed. Avoid introductory and wind-up phrases such as My duties included... and My responsibilities were Overall Appearance: Ask yourself and others if your document is easy to read and professional looking. Also, consider that the average recruiter may scan your resume for 30 seconds or less. Make sure that your most important information stands out. 3 II. Key Elements of a Successful Resume Your First and Last Name Phone number Email address Street address City, state & zip code _______________________________________________________________________________________________________ OBJECTIVE Create a statement describing or naming the position you are seeking to obtain. You may also include the specific field or area you are interested in and the skills and expertise you could contribute to the company. This section is optional and could be omitted or substituted with a Career Highlights or Summary of Qualifications section. _______________________________________________________________________________________________________ EDUCATION Institution City, State (Expected) Graduation Month Year Write out the full name of your (expected) degree; also list Minors and Concentrations GPA: 4.0/4.0 (it is recommended that you include your GPA if it is 3.0 or higher) Other possible information to include: Study Abroad experiences, Relevant Coursework, or Academic Awards and Honors. _______________________________________________________________________________________________________ EXPERIENCE, RELEVANT EXPERIENCE, INTERNSHIP EXPERIENCE [possible titles/descriptive headings] Organization, Your Job Title City, State Month Year - Month Year The position header above is one example of formatting. Other formats can include using two lines or rearranging the order of the Organization, Job Title, Location, and Dates to emphasize the most important elements. You can bold or italicize your title or your organization whichever is more relevant, but be consistent. In this section include bulleted accomplishment statements, which provide examples of times you have successfully used the skills employers are seeking. Start with a strong action verb, then follow with an explanation of what you were doing, describe how you did it, and, when possible, include any outcomes that you achieved. Remember, statements should ultimately convey your proficiency in one or more skill sets of interest to the employer by way of providing an example of when you have used them. Consider the following questions to help you create more effective bullet points: What was the result/outcome of your work? What were your accomplishments? How did you help the organization? What skills/knowledge did you enhance? How does this experience relate to your internship/employment goal? Organization, Your Job Title City, State Month Year - Month Year Bulleted statements should be in the proper tense (past or present tense) and use consistent grammar and punctuation. Be specific by including quantity, frequency, population, and impact of your work whenever possible. Make sure your resume is easy to read and not too text heavy. Avoid using colors, multiple fonts, pictures, being too brief, or making it too dense. Make it your own, but be professional. _______________________________________________________________________________________________________ ADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE, LEADERSHIP, HONORS, ACTIVITIES, COMMUNITY SERVICE, VOLUNTEER, PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT [possible titles/descriptive headings] Organization, Your Job Title City, State Month Year - Month Year Using multiple experience sections is optional and allows you to emphasize (by placing it closer to the top) your most relevant experience. Experiences within a section should be listed in reverse chronological order. Positions within this section should be formatted like previous experience sections, but may or may not include bullet points. In an additional experience section, you can include work experiences that may not be directly related to the job you are applying to, but add to your credibility by exemplifying a progressive work history. Emphasize your transferable skills, those that can be taken from one experience and applied elsewhere. Organization, Your Role (e.g. Member, Participant, Honoree, or Presenter) City, State Month Year - Month Year This section can also be an opportunity to share your experiences as a leader, honors received, community involvement, professional development activities, or membership in organizations. As illustrated, replace job title with the role you played. Including bullet points is optional, depending on what you wish to convey to a potential employer. _______________________________________________________________________________________________________ ADDITIONAL SKILLS [List skills that are testable and concrete. Soft skills such as communication, organizational, and interpersonal skills should not be listed here, but rather incorporated into your bulleted accomplishment statements above.] Technology: Try to include programs that would not be assumed based on education and include your proficiency level. For example: Advanced User of Microsoft Office Suite, including Outlook, Excel, and PowerPoint, as well as Adobe Photoshop. Languages: For example: Proficient in oral and written German; Beginner knowledge of Spanish. 4 III. Transferable Skills & Action Verbs TRANSFERABLE SKILLS Transferable skills are those that can be applied in multiple work settings. Consider incorporating them, in addition to those that are specific to your intended career field, by providing examples of when you have successfully used them in your bulleted accomplishment statements. Some examples of transferable skills include the following: CLERICAL Bookkeeping Classifying Collecting Compiling Computing Examining Filing Organizing Recording Word processing CREATIVE Designing Developing Establishing Illustrating Imagining Improvising Inventing performing Revitalizing Visualizing HUMAN RELATIONS Advising Assisting Counseling Empathizing Facilitating Guiding Listening Motivating Representing Serving PUBLIC RELATIONS Conducting Consulting Informing Planning Presenting Promoting Representing Responding Researching Writing RESEARCH Assessing Calculating Collecting Diagnosing Evaluating Examining Extrapolating Interviewing Investigating Synthesizing COMMUNICATION Editing Explaining Influencing Interpreting listening Mediating Promoting Speaking Translating Writing FINANCIAL Accounting Administering Allocating Auditing Balancing Calculating Forecasting Investing Projecting MANAGEMENT Communicating Consulting Coordinating Delegating Directing Evaluating Leading Negotiating Persuading Planning PROBLEM SOLVING Analyzing Appraising Diagnosing Examining Executing Planning Proving Reasoning Recognizing Validating TECHNICAL Adjusting Aligning Assembling Drafting Engineering Installing Observing Operating Programming Repairing TRAINING Adapting Communicating Demonstrating Enabling Encouraging Evaluating Explaining Instructing Planning Stimulating ACTION VERBS Beginning each bulleted accomplishment statement with a strong action verb helps to highlight your successes and allows a reader to get a sense of your skills by scanning the page prior to reading each individual bullet point. It is a good idea to vary the action verbs on your resume in order to appeal to different audiences. Below is a list of verbs to help get you started.

Resumes are used to help people market themselves and serve as a first introduction between job seekers and employers. Your resume should help an employer understand the skills, abilities, and qualifications you possess in addition to the academic/work/service experiences, awards, and community involvement you have completed. It should also help the employer understand how these qualifications/experiences relate to their hiring needs. Resume writing is both a skill and an art form. Writing a resume requires careful consideration, strategy, and construction each time you apply for a new position. This means every time you submit an application, you will need to write an altered resume tailored to each specific position. DO NOT PANIC! While it may seem like a lot of work in the beginning, the more you practice, the easier writing effective tailored resumes will become. This guide will help you learn the major elements of effective resume writing and walk you through the process of constructing a strong professional document. The General Rules of Resume Writing 1. Resumes should not be a step by step recap of everything you have ever done. Rather, it is a document that highlights the most relevant skills and experiences as they relate to the position for which you are applying. 2. Resumes should be written in the third person. Never use references to yourself in the first person, i.e. I , Me, or My. 3. Resumes for undergraduates should be confined to one page.* Resumes for professionals with a wealth of experience or with education levels of master s degrees or higher should be no longer than two pages.* *The exception to this rule is Federal resume writing 4. In the United States, resumes should not contain personal information regarding race, ethnicity, sex, gender, religious affiliation (unless affiliation is professional in nature), or age. Never include a picture on your resume. 5. The use of color and graphics is discouraged for all resumes except those submitted in design or arts industries. Formatting Your name should be the largest font size of the document (16 18 pt. recommended) and can be in any style you choose as long as it is READABLE (refrain from using script fonts). Your contact information can be smaller (10 pt. font). If your email address is automatically made into a hyperlink, remove the hyperlink by highlighting the email address, right clicking, and selecting remove hyperlink from the drop down list. Font size for the body of the document should be either 11 or 12 pt. in an easy-to-read style (i.e. Times New Roman, Arial, Verdana). Watch for spacing be sure that all spacing between sections is consistent. Dates should all align on the RIGHT side of the page. List all experiences within a section uniformly.

Traditional Resume Section Headings Resumes can have a variety of sections and section headers. The sections you choose to include in your resume are your choice, however there are some sections that MUST be included on every resume. Below, you will find a list of required sections as well as additional sections you may want to consider depending on your experience and industry. Contact Information (Required) Contact information should be the section at the very top of the resume that includes your name, telephone number, email address, and postal address. It does not need a heading. MARTIN MARYMOUNT mmarymount@marymount.edu (703) 555-5555 123 All Saints Way Arlington, VA, 22207 Marymount Center for Career Services 2013 Compiled by Amanda Sargent and Carin Usrey OBJECTIVE (Optional) The objective section is an element of the resume that is not generally recommended for college students but may be required by an employer. The objective should be a one to two sentence description of the kind of position you are looking to obtain. If you choose to include this section, be sure to specify the kind of industry and work you would like to do. Try not to be so general that the objective is unclear, but at the same time, not so specific that an employer can use the objective to screen you out of the hiring process. Example: Seeking an accounts specialist position at JP Morgan Chase s Arlington office. o Too specific! This objective tells the employer that you only want a position as an accounts specialist and only in one branch office. If there is a similar position in a different office, you may not be considered. Seeking an internship position. o Too general! This objective does not add any value to your resume as it does not clarify industry or experiences you are looking to gain. Seeking an entry level accounting position in top tier financial services firm with opportunities to both work with a diverse client base and gain experience in corporate accounts. o Good! A nice balance of the general industry interests and experiences the person is seeking without limiting what they might be considered for. QUALIFICATION HIGHLIGHTS/ PROFESSIONAL PROFILE (Optional) This section can be either a bulleted list or a paragraph summarizing your best qualities and most relevant experiences. This section gives the employer a general sense of how you are qualified for this position as well as how well your previous experiences have prepared you for the kind of work you may be performing in your new position. QUALIFICATION HIGHLIGHTS Motivated Fashion major with experience working in both the design and merchandising areas of the Fashion industry. Strong teamwork and leadership skills with ability to communicate effectively in verbal and written formats. Specialized skills in constructing wedding gowns and formal women s wear OR PROFESSIONAL PROFILE Aspiring public relations professional with radio and television broadcast media experience. Strong organizational, communication, and multi-tasking abilities with proven successes managing multiple projects and events. Hard-working and motivated individual with results-oriented perspective and commitment to excellence in customer satisfaction. EDUCATION (Required) This section should include any educational experiences you have completed or are currently completing AFTER HIGH SCHOOL. High school should not be included on a resume once a student has entered college. Items to include in the education section include the kind of degree you are obtaining (e.g. Bachelor of Arts), major and/or minor, the date you expect to graduate, name of your school, location of school (city and state only unless outside the USA), and GPA if it is 3.0 or higher (if not, do not include). Relevant coursework and study abroad experiences can also be included here. Marymount Center for Career Services 2013 Compiled by Amanda Sargent and Carin Usrey EDUCATION Bachelor of Science in Nursing, Degree Expected: May 2015 Marymount University, Arlington, VA; GPA: 3.7 OR EDUCATION B.A. in Business Administration, concentration in Finance, Minor in Math Marymount University, Arlington, VA; GPA: 3.2 Study Abroad: European Finance in London, England Relevant Coursework: Accounting, Finance I, Advanced Economics Expected: 05/14 Summer 2013 EXPERIENCE (Required) The experience section (or sections) of the resume is the area where a person should list previous experiences in which they have formally utilized or demonstrated work-related skills and abilities. These experiences can be formal job experiences, volunteer experiences, leadership experiences, or internship experiences. To include an experience, one should be able to associate a title with it (e.g. Volunteer, President, or formal job title). Experiences should be listed in reverse chronological order (most recent to least recent) and should be formatted uniformly. It is okay to have more than one experience section (e.g. a RELEVANT EXPERIENCE and ADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE section or WORK EXPERIENCE and VOLUNTEER EXPERIENCE section), but be sure to list the most relevant experiences first. The experience description should include the title of your position, the name and location of your company/organization, start and end dates (including month and year) and no less than two bullet points or sentences describing a skill, knowledge set, ability, qualification, or recognition/award received. Bullet points should emphasize transferable skills and should be no longer than 2 sentences (ideally only one sentence). If you have more than one experience section, additional experience sections may not require bullet points. EXPERIENCE Cashier, The Juice Factory 05/2011 Present Arlington, VA Demonstrated strong communication skills while interacting with and serving customers Exercised efficient time management when completing multiple tasks in fast-paced service environment OR Recognized as Employee of the Month for July 2011, March 2012, and January 2013 RELATED EXPERIENCE Graphic Design Intern, CoolArts Inc. January 2013 Present Vienna, VA Developed creative print marketing ads utilizing specialized design software Designed web portfolio for 3 resident artists resulting in increase in client business Assisted management in redesigning company logo ADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE Student Assistant, Lee Center at Marymount University Arlington, VA Waitress, Rock Bottom Brewery Arlington, VA Marymount Center for Career Services 2013 Compiled by Amanda Sargent and Carin Usrey September 2011 Present May 2011 September 2011 Constructing the bullet points or sentence descriptions of your experiences may seem a bit tricky at first. To help you get used to this style of writing, keep in mind that every bullet point should have three major components: An action verb to start the bullet, the skill you are trying to emphasize, and the tasks that evidence your ability to perform that skill. Demonstrated strong communication skills while interacting with and serving customers Action Verb Skill Tasks Construct your bullet points by following these steps: Step 1: Identify the skill/ability/qualification, etc. you would like to describe and write it down. To decide which skills to describe, you can use a variety of different methods. a) Go to the job posting/description of the position for which you are applying. Underline or highlight the skills the employer is looking for in an ideal candidate for this position. Identify the skills that you feel you most strongly possess and write bullet points around those skills. If your job has no job posting, use an online search engine like www.simplyhired.com or www.indeed.com to look for similar positions and use the key skills emphasized in these postings. If you would like a more comprehensive list of job search engines by industry, visit our website at www.marymount.edu/careerservices. b) Using the job title for which you are applying, do some research using www.onetonline.org or www.bls.gov/ooh. These websites outline and describe thousands of job titles in the USA and specifically list the kinds of skills and abilities required to effectively perform these jobs. c) Perform an informational interview (See Networking and Personal Branding E-Guide for more information on this kind of interview) with an industry professional either in a job similar to the job for which you are applying or in a position that supervises the kind of job for which you are applying and inquire as to what kinds of skills and abilities are most important for that job. d) Look at the transferable skills list towards the end of this e-guide. Step 2: Think about the tasks and duties you performed in your experience that effectively evidence your ability to perform this skill. Write these down in a list on a separate sheet of paper. Example: Previous position title: Student Front Desk Assistant Skill: Communication Tasks: Talked with customers at the front desk Answered phones Wrote emails to clients Step 3: Choose an action verb that helps the employer understand how or in what way you used or demonstrated this skill (See list of action verbs at the back of this document for help). Note that action verbs should be in PRESENT TENSE if you are currently working in the listed position and PAST TENSE if you are no longer working in the listed position. Marymount Center for Career Services 2013 Compiled by Amanda Sargent and Carin Usrey Example: Skill: Communication Sample Action Verbs: Exercised communication skills Utilized communication skills Demonstrated communication skills Step 4: Write your bullet point! Exercised communication skills when talking with customers, answering phones and writing emails to clients. Great! Now you have written an effective bullet point. It is strong as it is, however you can make it even stronger by adding in some additional descriptors like adjectives and quantifiers (a.k.a. numbers) to clarify your skills, communicate competence, or emphasize a positive result of your actions. Use adjectives cautiously! Stay away from claims of excellence like Amazing, Fantastic, Superb, Excellent, etc. as these adjectives may be perceived as an indication of arrogance rather than confidence. For a list of strong adjectives, see our adjective list at the back of this document. Adjective Quantifiers Exercised strong communication skills when talking with 20+ customers per day, answering phones, and writing emails to clients. RESEARCH and/or PROJECTS (Optional) This is a section commonly used by students to help show employers relevant academic work that has allowed them to develop skills the employer values. You can include any research papers, individual or group projects, and presentations on relevant topics in this section. The description should include the title of the project or paper, the semester(s) date in which it was completed, the name of the school/organization at which it was conducted/completed, the location of the school/organization, and a 2-3 sentence description of the project, skills used, and results. If you are going to list a group project, make sure to clearly state that it was a group project. You must not take credit for the work of others. PROJECTS/RESEARCH Senior Seminar Business Project (Group Project) Fall 2012 Marymount University, Arlington, VA Exercised effective team work skills while collaborating with group of 6 students to develop business plan for hypothetical manufacturing company. Conducted formal oral presentation to School of Business; received grade of A. SKILLS (Required) The Skills section should be reserved for concrete technical and language skills only. Computer applications you are familiar with and foreign language proficiencies should be listed here (name of language and proficiency level: basic, intermediate, advanced, and fluent). Note that for IT majors, this section will be much more extensive and include several subheadings for additional technical proficiencies (e.g. applications, browsers, languages, etc.) For certain majors, including social media proficiencies (Facebook/Twitter/Pinterest) may also be a good idea. If you have no foreign language skills, simply do not list. SKILLS Technical: Language: Microsoft Office Suite, Photo Shop, Types 45 WPM Fluent in French, Basic Spanish Marymount Center for Career Services 2013 Compiled by Amanda Sargent and Carin Usrey ACTIVITIES/HONORS/AFFILIATIONS (Optional, but strongly recommended) This section is where you should place any extracurricular activities (e.g. club membership, college sports, community service, volunteer work that is not listed as experience), professional organization memberships, and awards/recognition you have received. This list should contain information that is relevant to the job for which you are applying or gives the employer a better understanding of your character. You can have a separate section for each of these headers or you can combine them as shown below. If you only want to describe one item header (e.g. only ACTIVITIES) that is fine as well. The purpose of this section is to help the employer understand what sets you apart from other individuals with similar education, experiences, and skills. ACTIVITIES/HONORS/AFFILIATIONS President, STEM Club, Marymount University Member, National Association of Science and Technology Students Presidential Scholarship, U.S. Department of Education Volunteer, Helping Hands Homeless Shelter 09/2012- Present 09/2011 - Present 05/2011 05/2011 09/2011 2. Industry-Specific Section Headings It is important to note that every industry has its own standards for resume writing. These general instructions are a fantastic guideline to get you started, but, to make the appropriate finishing touches, it would be best to check in with industry professionals, professors, and your Career Services office to be sure you are covering all of the necessary information for your industry. There are some industry-specific resume examples in this document, but if you would like to view more resume samples, log on to Jobs4Saints and visit their Resume Gallery. CURRICULUM VITAE (CVs) A Curriculum Vitae in the United States is a special kind of resume-like document that is primarily used by college professors and individuals pursuing high-level education/research or executive careers. It is very similar to the traditional resume only it is much longer (no page limit) and includes additional sections for Research, Publications, Teaching/Training Experience, etc. It may also go into more detail than a traditional resume about the types of accomplishments a person has made. CVs in the US are highly tailored to each position and are written in a similar format to the resume, the difference being in length and additional section headings. For additional assistance in constructing a CV, please contact the Center for Career Services. It is important to note that many other countries (especially European countries like the United Kingdom, France, etc.) refer to what Americans call a traditional resume as a CV. This means that if you are applying to a company in London, England, and they ask for a CV, they are really asking for your traditional 1-2 page US resume with some additional information. For information about writing resumes for careers abroad, contact the Center for Career Services and/or the Center for Global Education. FEDERAL RESUMES Federal resumes are written similarly to public and private sector resumes, but differ in a few specific ways. The section headings for a Federal resume are generally the same and experiences are described either in paragraphs or bullet points. Here are the ways a Federal resume differs from other resumes: Federal resumes have no page limit and are generally 3-5 pages long depending on experience The OBJECTIVE section of a Federal resume contains the title and GS code for the position Federal resumes contain significantly more personal information including your Social Security Number, Citizenship Status, Veteran s Status, and Security Clearances. Experiences are described much more in depth and include information about your salary, hours worked, address of company you worked at, supervisor s name and contact (and if it is all right to contact them) There is no timeline limit for Federal resumes, you should include all work experiences regardless of relevance.

Page 2 TRANSFERABLE SKILLS: As you begin your search for a career and/or job, it is important to know your qualifications and communicate these skills to an employer through your resume, cover letter, and interview. Over the years you have developed many skills through your coursework, extracurricular activities, and life experiences. Review the list below and identify which transferrable skills you have and reflect on how you acquired these skills. Use this information when creating your resume to describe your experiences and the skills gained from these experiences. For example, if you have researched a topic for class and then wrote, edited, and presented a final research paper in front of your peers, you have used skills (gathering information, writing, problem-solving, presenting) which are not limited to that specific academic discipline, but are transferable to many occupations. Research and planning Human relations Organizing, management and leadership Work survival The skillful expression and interpretation of knowledge and ideas. The search for specific knowledge and the ability to conceptualize future needs and solutions. The use of interpersonal skills for resolving conflict, relating to and helping people. Ability to supervise and guide individuals and groups in the completion of goals. The daily skills that assist in promoting effective production and work satisfaction.

Generally a graduate resume should be 2-3 full pages and a CV should be 3-5 pages long. However, based on your experiences, career field, and the position description, it could be longer or shorter. Whatever the case, only print your document on one side of the paper and include your name and the page number at the top of each page. Avoid using a resume or CV template. This decreases your ability to personalize and make changes as your document evolves. Your resume or CV should be well organized, without spelling errors, and easy to read. An employer spends a short amount of time reading your document it is imperative that the employer clearly sees the most important qualifications. To organize your document, you may choose to use bold, italics, all caps, indenting, and bullets. You will want to use these sparingly to emphasize the most important information. Avoid pictures, graphics, non-black ink, shading, and symbols instead of traditional, round, solid bullet points. It is a good idea to start with a 1-inch margin on each side. You can expand the margins if need be. Font size should be between 10-12 point, and you will want to choose easy to read font styles, such as Times New Roman, Arial, or Garamond. Keep font size and style consistent throughout your CV (except for your name, which should be a larger size). Present your resume or CV on quality bond paper (20 pound) choose white or off-white to ensure your document is easy to read. If you are filling out an online application where you cannot upload your document directly, keep the format simple when filling in required information. If you are requested to submit your documents via email, save your resume or CV and cover letter (if applicable) as attachments. Include a brief note in the body of the email stating your purpose. TIPS FOR RESUME AND CV WRITING: Make sure that your resume or CV is a unique and personal document. It is a great idea to look at examples of resumes or CVs but also important to make it your own. There are some suggestions that we provide when writing a resume or CV, but there are also options and room for choice. If you give your document to several people, they may all give you different feedback. Beyond some of our strongly suggested guidelines, resumes and CVs are subjective. Be 100% honest and factual. Avoid abbreviations. Organize your document so the most important information is at the top. Do not include a work history. Rather, include your most related experiences or those where you demonstrated a high level of skill. Personal information, such as marital status, age, ethnicity, height, and weight should not be included. Avoid personal pronouns (I, my, we) and complete sentences to describe your experiences. Start your statements with action verbs. Always proofread your resume or CV. Do not solely rely on spell check. Some employers may eliminate candidates based on errors. It is suggested that you tailor your resume or CV to the job description. You may have more than one version of your document depending on the positions to which you are applying . You may change the order of sections to list more relevant areas of your experience closer to the top. Remember that your resume or CV is YOUR marketing tool. Many times it is an employer s first impression of you. It is also a work in progress that you will continually revise.

Assistant Professor/Director of Transition and Employment Center, Kent State U., Kent, OH, 1989-95 Associate Professor, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, 1995-Present V. Brief Work History My involvement in the fields of SPED and REHAB extends back to the early 1970 . While an undergraduate student, I was employed as a drug rehabilitation and crisis intervention counselor and I volunteered as a cub-scout master for a troop that integrated youth with disabilities into the general troop. My work while achieving my M.Ed. and Ed.S., involved the development and delivery of habilitation and educational services to person with developmental disabilities. During that period I was a teacher, a director of a community educational program, and performed research and demonstration activities at Kent State University. While in Kentucky, I worked towards developing integrated and state of the arteducational and rehabilitation services for persons with disabilities. Further, I spent two years attempting to assist persons with disabilities accessing appropriate employment outcomes. Upon returning to Ohio, I worked with adults that had a college education, to access meaningful and appropriate employment. In my role as Associate Director and Assistant Professor, my efforts focused on systematically address education, employment, and transitional issues for persons with the full range of disabilities. With my return to Kentucky as an Associate Professor of Special Education, my focus has continued be on transition and employment issues for youth and adults with disabilities. I have participated in a wide range of transition programs that include consulting on two educational systems change grants (Kentucky s Transition Systems Change Project and Kentucky s Severe Systems Change Project). Further, in Kentucky, I have directed numerous state and federally funded demonstration and research grants in transition and employment. I consult with the Kentucky Board of Education and the Kentucky Association of School Boards on a variety of education issues. Until the summer of 2002 I was coordinator of Kentucky s State Improvement Grant in Special Education (a federal grant designed to improve special education services throughout the state). Since then, I have directed the special education and distance education programs in special education, overseen numerous grants and projects, and taught coursework in special education. A.

It is the standard representation of credentials within academia. The full CV is only used when applying for academic positions in four-year institutions. Do not use a CV when applying to community colleges use a teacher-focused r sum instead. Tailor your CV to the specific positions to which you are applying and place more relevant sections earlier in the document. For a position at a teaching-focused liberal arts college, the CV will strongly emphasize teaching. For a position at a research-intensive university, the CV will accentuate research. Format can vary by field, so also seek disciplinary-specific advice from advisers, professors, and others within your field. There are no length restrictions for CVs. FORMATTING Your CV must be well organized and easy to read. Choose an effective format and be consistent. Use bolds, italics, underlines, and capitalization to draw attention.

In general, place the name of the position, title, award, or institution on the left side of the page and associated dates on the right.

First Avenue Stanley, WI 54768 Dear Ms. Gonzales: Where all students learn at a high level, was the first thing I was drawn to while reviewing your website. One sentence, packed with a great deal of meaning. The strides Stanley-Boyd has made in math and reading to achieve 90% of your students passing their reading tests and 83% proficient or advanced in Math is something of which I hope to be a part. It is for these reasons I would love the opportunity to join your community as a 2nd grade teacher. In May 2013 I will be graduating from St. Norbert College in De Pere, Wisconsin with a Bachelors of Arts degree in Elementary Education and a minor in Language Arts. My strengths in building connections with students, faculty and parents, using technology to effectively enhance the classroom, and differentiate instruction based on the needs of my students are just a few of things I can offer to Stanley-Boyd. Some of the ways I build strong relationships with students, faculty, and parents is through attending after school events, participating in a district meeting, and opening lines of communication via newsletters, e-mails, phone calls, and conferences. Two additional strengths I possess are the ability to use technology effectively and differentiate and engage students. For example, with my first grade students I used iPads during guided reading where high leveled students spelled sight words, middle leveled students read sight words, and lower leveled students traced letters while practicing letter sounds. Another example is in 8th grade advanced Language Arts where students read a novel regarding utopias. Students then reflected on their own utopia, wrote about it, and then presented using WebPages, movies, or podcast. Finally, at the end of the year students reflected on the unit choosing their favorite piece; many chose to write about the technology. I am excited about this opportunity to join your team of educators, and bring my various strengths with me. I would love to assist Stanley-Boyd Elementary School in the continuation of being a spotlight school. Thank you for considering my qualifications for this 2nd grade position, I look forward to hearing from you in the near future to discuss my qualifications. If you would like to contact me, I can be reached at (920) 337-5555 or sam.knight@snc.edu. Again, I look forward to this great opportunity at Stanley-Boyd. Go Orioles!

Upon reviewing my resume, I m sure you will find that I am qualified for a number of positions related to language teaching. I have had over five years of teaching experience here in Korea, teaching students of various ages and ability. In addition, two years ago I was promoted to English Teacher Coordinator at the English conversation school where I had been teaching, which illustrates how effective I was as a teacher. Finally, I self-published a textbook as well as a study on the influence of the American military in towns with Korean military bases (copies available upon request). I hope you will consider me for any positions you may have. Please contact me at the above address for a possible interview. I am eager to work with you in Hawai i. Thank you for your consideration.

Specialist III 2545 McCarthy Mall, Bilger 101 University of Hawai i Honolulu, HI 96822 Dear Dr. Hiple: I am applying for the Educational Specialist position at the SLTCC/NFLRC, and have attached the UH Form 64 (APT Application for Employment), my current curriculum vita, and three letters of recommendation As my CV indicates, I received my Master degree in ESL from Temple University Tokyo school. One of the unique aspects of this program is its Weekend Seminar series, which invites experts from all over the world to do 14-hour seminars on an area of specialty. While at Temple, I took 9 credits of these seminars, from people such as Richard Schmidt, Sandra Savignon, Teresa Pica, and Paul Nation. I feel that the variety of perspectives these seminars provided have helped make me a more rounded teacher and administrator. I have eight years of experience teaching English in Japan, to students aging from nine years old through senior citizens, and at levels from beginner through advanced. I have taught private lessons, at language schools, at a vocational school, and at a university. I primarily taught conversation, but also had courses in writing and reading. In all my conversation classes, I strived to lead more students toward taking more responsibility for their learning, by giving them more control over the topics and by teaching and practicing conversation and communication strategies. In writing classes, I focused on making students aware of aspects of creative writing (and giving them opportunities to playwith these aspects), as well as working with them on writing essays on topics of their own choosing. Finally, in reading classes, I tried to use real materials (to the extent these were available) for practicing different skills. I also believe strongly in being a reflective practitioner, and keep a teaching journalon a regular basis. In addition, I served three years as an administrator at the vocational school where I taught. In this role, I was in charge of hiring teachers, curriculum development, textbook selection, scheduling, and working with teachers to ensure that they were sharing lesson plans and teaching insights. Finally, I am also interested in materials development. I am currently working on a writing textbook, which I hope to send to a publisher in the next few months. I would be happy to provide copies of textbook units, or any other teaching materials you might find useful to help you make a decision. Please let me know if there is anything you would like me to provide. I would appreciate hearing from you at your earliest convenience. Thank you again for your consideration. Yours truly, XXXXXXX 2002 by the Second Language Teaching & Curriculum Center (TiPPS) 3 SAMPLE C: August 26, 1999 Personnel SLTCC/NFLRC Ed. Specialist III 2545 McCarthy Mall, Bilger 101 University of Hawai i Honolulu, HI 96822 Dear David Hiple: My name is Jim Yoshioka, and I am applying for the UH Educational Specialist III APT position (#92207). I feel certain that my previous educational, teaching, research, advising, administrative, and professional experiences (described in detail here and in my curriculum vitae and application), have well prepared me to successfully handle the job s duties, responsibilities, challenges, and possibilities and that, if given the chance, I can be a valuable, enthusiastic, and effective asset to your center and its mission. I have already served the NFLRC previously as a Graduate Assistant and co-author of Tech. Report #18, and I hope that I will have the opportunity to work with the NFLRC once again! Considering the minimum and desired qualifications for the position, I meet them in the following ways. First of all, in terms of education, I graduated with an MA in ESL from the University of Hawai i at Manoa this past May, my scholarly paper (an interpretive qualitative study focusing on workplace pragmatics) earning the department s Harry Whitten Prize for Scholarly Excellence. In addition, I also hold a BA in English (teaching emphasis) and a minor in Japanese from the University of California at Davis, these multiple perspectives on language education working together to better inform my teaching and curricular decision-making. In terms of actual second/foreign language educational job experience, I worked for 3 years as an Assistant English Teacher (EFL) at 4 junior high schools in Ichihara City, Chiba Prefecture, Japan, where my main duties included researching, developing, and adapting communicative activities for the classroom to develop the students English listening and speaking abilities, teaching 3-4 classes a day, helping with grading and test development as well as various school-wide events and activities, and holding city-wide teacher training seminars to improve the Japanese teachers English ability. More recently, I worked for 2 years as a Graduate Teaching Assistant (ESL) for the English Language Institute (ELI) at UH Manoa, where I taught both ELI 73 (Writing for Foreign Students) and ELI 80 (Advanced Listening & Speaking). My responsibilities encompassed the full range of curriculum development - conducting needs analyses in my classes; updating ELI course goals and objectives and developing professionally in departmental meetings; choosing appropriate textbooks; administering and rating placement exams and reporting the results to students; developing new materials and activities on my own and in collaboration with my colleagues; creating lesson plans and teaching my students with an ear to their needs and interests, with an eye to the research and multimedia technology available to enhance their language learning experience, and with the spirit of building on their strengths and improving their weak areas through collaborative group work and individualized feedback and attention from me; and finally, evaluation of all parts of the process. Besides these 5 years of progressively responsible work in foreign/second language teaching, I have also worked previously as an ESL writing tutor, a Japanese tutor, and a Macintosh lab assistant/writing tutor (which again reflect my educational background). It is clear, however, particularly from looking at the NFLRC job s duties and expectations, that apart from having the appropriate type of background, having excellent organizational, administrative, 2002 by the Second Language Teaching & Curriculum Center (TiPPS) 4 and communicative skills is of prime importance. I have held a number of jobs, both paid and voluntary, where I successfully brought those abilities into play. For example, as an Academic Peer Advisor for the Division of Education at UC Davis, I not only met regularly with students interested in the UCD teaching credential program (advising them about program prerequisites, applications, deadlines, scheduling, program options, general college requirements, etc.) but also, on my own initiative, developed a number of systems and resources to help the office and the advising sessions run more smoothly and effectively. These included developing and writing the division s first newsletter for teaching credential program hopefuls (full of information and important reminders), maintaining the mailing list for it, keeping records of students visits and concerns for future advising purposes, and revamping, compiling, and editing out-of-date division handouts and references for more informative, up-to-date, and effective advising sessions. I received many compliments from advisees, staff, and faculty alike for my support services, and after I left, they told me they had to hire two peer advisors to take my place (which they did). More recently, I have helped organize the Literacy for Change: Community-Based Approaches Conference in August 1997, using Pagemaker to create its registration materials and conference booklet under the direction of Dr. Kathy Davis (ESL). That very same summer, I also served as Production Manager (and actor) for the play Katipunan: The Cry for Freedom, where my duties included publicity and public relations, being a liason between the director, assistant director, set designer, and costume designer, and organizing cast functions, scheduling, and so on. And finally, for the past year, I have been carrying out writing research and administrative work for the Manoa Writing Program at UH Manoa including Placement Exam registration, administration, rating, database maintenance, and research; Writing-Intensive course designation and research; publication of the most recent issues of Writing Matters; website development and updating; participation in MWP Board Meetings as well as system-wide Written Communication meetings; research reports; and office responsibilities such as computer/server maintenance, answering faculty/student phone or in-person queries, and assisting staff with routine business. Two final qualifications involve competency with computers and in a foreign language. In practically all of the jobs mentioned throughout my application, I have used Macintosh computers extensively (I have one at home as well), except at the Manoa Writing Program, where we use PCs. In terms of programs, I have worked with the following applications: Microsoft Word, Word Perfect, Pagemaker (word processing/publishing); SPSS, Foxpro, Excel, ISIS (database storage and analysis); Norton Utilities, Filemaker Pro, various anti-virus programs (file back-up and protection); Netscape, Telnet, Uhunix (pine, pico, aliases), HTML Writer (internet and WWW); and other miscellaneous programs such as Daedalus. As for foreign language proficiency, besides receiving a minor in Japanese (after 4 years of study), being a Japanese tutor, and teaching and living in Japan for three years, I also served as a Graduate Research Assistant for the Japanese Department at UH Manoa. For two years, I assisted Dr. John Haig with expanding, updating, revising, editing, and proofreading Nelson s JapaneseEnglish Character Dictionary for its third edition. Other graduate assistants came and went, but I was continued through the end because of my good balance of accuracy and speed. For these reasons, I believe I am prepared to handle the interesting challenges and demands of the job with service, a smile, and efficiency; all I ask for is the chance. I look forward to hearing from you, and thank you for considering my application! Sincerely, Jim Yoshioka 2002 by the Second Language Teaching & Curriculum Center (TiPPS) 5", "gender": "m"}},

Your company has an impressive track record for mentoring entry-level accountants plus offering valuable experience in auditing, tax compliance and cost accounting. As a Rowan University senior, anticipating graduation in May, I am anxious to interview with you during your upcoming recruitment trip to our campus. My strong academic performance and outstanding internship experience make me a strong candidate for a junior accountant position with Coopers and Lybrand. As an honor student and recipient of the Medallion Scholar Award for the internationally accredited College of Business, I was chosen to intern for the local public accounting firm of Money and Associates CPA. At Money and Associates, I assisted with the preparation of clients for corporate tax audits and performed intake consultations for tax preparation purposes. My supervising accountant, Mr. Charles Money invited me to continue my internship for a second semester. On my internship evaluation form he wrote, John knowledge and ability to grasp accounting procedures and principles is quite impressive. His computer skills and team-working abilities make him a valuable resource. I believe John will develop into a top-notch accountant.Enclosed is a copy of my resume, which outlines my qualifications in further detail.

I was excited to read your ad since I have had a long-time interest in pharmaceutical sales and your products sound particularly appealing to me. As a college student, I had the opportunity to experience in sales and customer service. Of particular interest to you, I worked at Glassboro Medical Supply serving customers who enter our store. Through reading professional periodicals and magazines that are sent to me as an employee of Glassboro Medical Supply, I have become knowledgeable of the different types of medical supplies. This knowledge enables me to fully address our customers medical supply needs and answer their questions. Utilizing my proactive approach to sales and customer service, I increased sales this year by 20% over last year s figures. In light of my accomplishment, my supervisor has given me the responsibility of developing a plan to market medical supplies to local drug stores. In addition to my work experience, I recently completed a course in drug/pharmacology terminology at the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia. Completion of this course increased my knowledge of medicines and their effects. I have always had a strong interest in the medical/pharmaceutical sales field and have attempted to gain the knowledge and experience needed to work effectively in that capacity. With that in mind, I feel I am highly qualified for the position of sales representative for Savitz Pharmaceuticals. My enclosed resume outlines my qualifications in further detail. I welcome an opportunity to meet with you at your convenience. I can be reached at 856-256-4322 or on my cell phone at 856- 2222348. Thank you for your time and consideration. John Q.

Check out the career advising, workshops and other resources we offer! 2 Teaching Resume Aesthetics, Content & Editing Writing a Teaching Resume is an art, not a science. There is no one correct way to formulate your resume, but there are some best practices and standards that the Career Center recommends. Stand out from the crowd with high quality content and a clearly written, error-free document. Teaching Resumes need to be aesthetically pleasing, dense with relevant content and properly edited. Aesthetics: Always remember to have a classic, professional resume. This includes the font choice, consistency , an appropriate amount of white space, length and overall appearance of the resume. Teaching is a creative and innovative profession; a teaching resume should be strictly professional. Professional means there should not be any pictures, colors or designs on your resume. Those within the education field will immediately exclude you from potential candidates if your resume has poor aesthetics and is not professional. Content: While aesthetic mistakes can take you out of the running for a position, the content of the resume is what will make you stand out from the crowd. Experiences you choose to include in your teaching resume should be the most relevant to your target audience. Accomplishment statements are intended to expand on your relevant experience and highlight your expertise. Look to page 7 for more advice on accomplishment statements. Editing : Editing is a necessary component of resume writing that is often underutilized. Editing is where you and others assure that content is accurate and aesthetics are pin point. Have as many people proofread your resume as possible and stop by the Career Center for an extra set of eyes! Look to page 12 for detail of Career Center services and workshops specifically for Teachers! Reverse Chronological Order: Within each section on the resume, your experience must go in reverse chronological order, meaning from new to old. Accomplishment Statements (Bullet Points): Eliminate the pronoun I at the beginning of each bullet point as this is assumed. Avoid introductory and wind-up phrases such as My duties included... and My responsibilities were . Describe achievements, rather than listing duties, quantify outcomes whenever possible, and be sure to highlight your proficiency in teaching and transferable skills. More description on Accomplishment statements can be found on page 7. Length: With rare exceptions, student teachers and new teachers should keep their resume to 1 page. If you have difficulty narrowing down your resume, consider removing elements that are not closely related to teaching; Ask yourself, Will this experience enhance and support my future in education and teaching? Margins: Make your resume visually attractive by using an appropriate amount of whitespace to allow the reader s eye to rest. Using .8 inch to 1.5 inch margins is standard practice. Font: Use a professional font that is easy to read. Times New Roman, Arial, and Courier New are good choices. A 10-12 point font size is recommended. Consistency: The formatting of a resume needs to be consistent. For example, if you choose to bold a job title, make sure you bold every job title. Also, make sure that everything lines up neatly on the page. Accuracy: Your resume, and all other job search materials, must be 100% error free. Be sure to carefully read through your resume, checking grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Editing a resume can always use another set of eyes; have as many people proofread it as possible, and, come to the Career Center! Paper Quality: Use a high quality paper stock (24-32 lb, 25% cotton fiber, 8-1/2 x 11) when mailing your resume or bringing one to an interview. Use the same paper for cover letters and thank you letters. White, ivory, or light grey are good choices. 3 Key Elements of a Successful Teacher Resume Mandatory Elements These elements need to appear on every teaching resume. Identification Needs to include your first and last name (should be the largest font size, but not too oversized to look out of place), contact information : phone number and professional email address, and your street address, city, state & zip code Certification List all certifications and when you expect to receive them: Early Childhood (Type 04), Elementary (Type 03), Secondary (Type 09), Special Education (Type 10), Physical Education (Type 10) List any endorsements you expect Example: Illinois Initial Elementary Certificate (Type 03), expected July 2014 Middle Grade Endorsement expected in Language Arts Education Institution, City, State (Expected) Graduation Month Year Write out the full name of your (expected) degree; also list Minors and Concentrations *Please note that all degrees are written in singular, for example: Bachelor of Arts in Elementary Education GPA: 4.0/4.0 (it is recommended that you include your GPA if it is 3.0 or higher) Other possible information to include: Study Abroad, Relevant Coursework, or Academic Awards and Honors Experience Experience is mandatory and the heart of any teaching resume; however, it can be represented in a variety of ways. Choose the most rich, concrete, relevant teaching experiences to put on your resume. Keep in mind that after each experience, there will be bullet points (accomplishment statements) detailing your experience more fully. Refer to page 7 for more advice on creating an accomplishment statement. Important Note: within each section, experiences are to be listed in reverse chronological order. Teaching Experience (Student Teaching) Student teaching is your most relevant teaching experience directly out of college. Therefore, it will directly follow the education section and take up the most amount of space on a teaching resume directly after college. Include specific lesson plans, classroom management skills and teaching styles that make you unique. Refer to page 7 to find out more about creating a proper accomplishment statement. Teaching Related Experience Highlight paid or unpaid experiences though which you have gained teaching related skills. Examples include, but are not limited to: camp counselor, tutor, coach and nanny. Example: Nanny, Smith Family, Chicago, IL March 2008-Present Interactive Field Experience Focus on a select few experiences in which you played an active role in the classroom and with students. Example: Second Grade, Washington Elementary School, Chicago, IL September 2009 October 2009 Work/Professional Experience Principals will be most interested in your teaching experience; however, you may include skills obtained for another industry that are transferable to a classroom. For example, training, collaborating or mentoring. Optional Elements These are other options to include on your resume: Volunteer Experience, Leadership Experience, Honors/Activities, Special Skills and Interests, Professional Development 4 POOR RESUME SAMPLE JAMES WALTON 2261 N.

Consider incorporating them, in addition to those that are specific to your intended career field, by providing examples of when you have successfully used them in your bulleted accomplishment statements. Some examples of transferable skills include the following: CLERICAL Bookkeeping Classifying Collecting Compiling Computing Examining Filing Organizing Recording Word processing CREATIVE Designing Developing Establishing Illustrating Imagining Improvising Inventing performing Revitalizing Visualizing HUMAN RELATIONS Advising Assisting Counseling Empathizing Facilitating Guiding Listening Motivating Representing Serving PUBLIC RELATIONS Conducting Consulting Informing Planning Presenting Promoting Representing Responding Researching Writing RESEARCH Assessing Calculating Collecting Diagnosing Evaluating Examining Extrapolating Interviewing Investigating Synthesizing COMMUNICATION Editing Explaining Influencing Interpreting listening Mediating Promoting Speaking Translating Writing FINANCIAL Accounting Administering Allocating Auditing Balancing Calculating Forecasting Investing Projecting MANAGEMENT Communicating Consulting Coordinating Delegating Directing Evaluating Leading Negotiating Persuading Planning PROBLEM SOLVING Analyzing Appraising Diagnosing Examining Executing Planning Proving Reasoning Recognizing Validating TECHNICAL Adjusting Aligning Assembling Drafting Engineering Installing Observing Operating Programming Repairing TRAINING Adapting Communicating Demonstrating Enabling Encouraging Evaluating Explaining Instructing Planning Stimulating ACTION VERBS Beginning each bulleted accomplishment statement with a strong action verb helps to highlight your successes and allows a reader to get a sense of your skills by scanning the page prior to reading each individual bullet point. It is a good idea to vary the action verbs on your resume in order to appeal to different audiences. Below is a list of verbs to help get you started. A Achieved Acted Adapted Adjusted Administered Advanced Advised Altered Analyzed Appraised Arranged Assembled Assessed Audited B Balanced Budgeted Built C Calculated Calibrated Categorized Charted Classified Coached Collected Combined Communicated Compiled Composed Computed Conducted Configured Consolidated Constructed Consulted Contrasted Controlled Converted Convinced Coordinated Counseled Counted Created Cultivated D Decided Decreased Defined Delivered Demonstrated Designed Detected Determined Developed Devised Diagnosed Differentiated Distributed Documented Doubled Drafted E Edited Eliminated Encouraged Engineered Enhanced Ensured Established Estimated Evaluated Examined Executed Expanded Expedited F Facilitated Filed Filled Forecasted Formulated Fostered Fulfilled G Gained Gathered Generated Grew Guided H Handled Headed Hired I Identified Illustrated Implemented Improved Increased Influenced Informed Initiated Inspected Installed Instituted Instructed Integrated Intended Interviewed invented Investigated L Launched Lectured Led Liaised Logged M Maintained Managed Manufactured Marketed Measured Mediated Mentored Migrated Minimized Monitored Motivated N Negotiated O Obtained Operated Orchestrated Ordered Organized Originated Oversaw P Performed Persuaded Planned Posted Prepared Prescribed Presented Priced Processed Produced Promoted Proposed Protected Provided Purchased R Realized Received Recommended Reconciled Recorded Recruited Redesigned Reduced Referred Removed Reorganized Repaired Reported Represented Researched Resolved Restructured Revamped Reviewed Revised Revitalized Routed S Scheduled Selected Separated Served Serviced Set up Simplified Sold Solved Specified Started Strategized Streamlined Strengthened Studied Summarized Supervised Supplied Supported T Tested Tracked Trained Transformed Translated Troubleshot U Updated Upgraded V Verified W Weighed Wired Won 6 Constructing an Achievement Statement (Bullet Point) Under each position you have on your resume, list bulleted accomplishment statements. These statements should explain what you did in the position, how you did it and the results of your actions. The skills you feel you have gained from your teaching related experiences should be represented through your accomplishment statements. Brainstorm each experience/position and create bullet points unique to you. Bullet Point Formula Action Verb + Example + Result Action Verb: Always begin a bullet point with an action verb. Use a variety of action verbs to show the variety of skills you have. Average Bullet Point with Action Verb Tutored an eighth grade student Example: Give specifics as to what you did at that position. This will make you unique. Better Bullet Point with Action Verb and Example Tutored an eighth grade student in pre-algebra Result: State what you achieved from your example; what was the purpose of you doing what you did? Perfect Achievement Statement with Action Verb, Example and Result Tutored an eighth grade student in pre-algebra, using teacher s curriculum to raise her grade from a C to B+ over the course of a year Buzz Words These are words you should be familiar with going into a teaching career. Buzz words are extremely effective when used in moderation on a resume and with direct examples to support their claim. Reflect on any teaching specific language and resources which you have utilized in your teaching. Below is a list of potential buzz words to include on a resume. Multi-cultural instruction Team teaching Thematic unit Critical thinking Literacy (Literature) circles Guided reading Differentiated instruction Modified instruction Interactive exercises Interdisciplinary learning Manipulative Student centers Peer teaching Response to Intervention (RtI) Cooperative Learning Balanced Literacy IEP (Individual Education Plan) ESL/ELL Students Developmentally appropriate practice (specifically for Pre-K) 7 Caroline Baltman SAMPLE : Secondary 2355 56th Court; Lisle, IL 60016; 224-639-5330 cbaltman@gmail.com Objective Obtaining a teaching position that utilizes my passion for teaching chemistry to create a positive experience for the students by implementing various teaching methods and coordinating with other teachers to work on interdisciplinary units Certification Illinois Initial Secondary Certification (Type 09) in Science, expected June 2011 High School Endorsements in Chemistry Regular, AP and Honors classes, Biology, Earth Science and Physics Middle school endorsement expected in Science Education DePaul University; Chicago, IL Bachelor of Science in Secondary Education Chemistry; expected June 2011 Anticipated Graduating GPA: 3.75 / 4.0; High Honor Roll; Deans list all quarters in attendance Teaching Experience Student Teacher: Wells High School; Grades, 11-12, Chicago IL; Spring 2011 Facilitated learning of honors and regular chemistry for 3rd and 4th year students using student-centered lessons and activities Established acceptable classroom behavior guide with students comments to minimize future class room management issues Discussed students learning improvement and behavior in class with parents during the parent-teacher conference Utilized many student-centered learning techniques, including demonstrations, molecular model building, and discovery labs Devised a demonstration to connect acid-base reactions with the concept of limiting and excess reactants, related the demonstration to students daily life, and allowed students to work in cooperative learning groups to analyze examples Created activities that show the relationship between chemistry concepts and everyday life to engage and motive students Modified curriculum for a English Language Learner and various Special Education Students in the regular education classroom by translating the concepts in student s native language or by explaining the concepts in various simpler steps Assisted students with preparation for ACT and PSAE standardized testing by providing explanation for various scientific concepts while working on practice test questions and modeling various reading strategies Tutored students before, during, and after school Attended various workshops during the 8th Annual CPS Service-Learning Conference Interactive Field Experience Amundsen High School, Junior Chemistry Classes , Chicago, IL; Fall 2010 Observed regular, honors, and A.P. chemistry classes to better understand students needs, implemented various activities and observed various classroom management techniques Lane Technical High School; Sophomore Chemistry Classes, Chicago, IL; Winter 2010 Gained experience on various teaching methods by observing two teachers working with physics and chemistry classes Williams Junior High School; 7th Grade Self Contained Science Class, Elmwood Park, IL; Fall 2009, Assisted a sixth grade class with an eco-system experiment, and demonstrated how to actively take notes and how to point out important information in assigned reading to one special education student during an active reading assignment Skills and Interests Eager to sponsor various student organizations such as South Asian clubs and cultural awareness groups Fluent in Urdu and Hindi Interested in organizing after school science sessions to provide students with additional help Proficient with Microsoft Words, Excel, Power Point, and Graphic Analysis and Origin programs mostly used for physics, mathematics, and chemistry Interested in participating in drug abuse resistance programs and other health awareness programs 8 SAMPLE : Secondary Silva E.

Strong resumes do more than summarize your educational background and work history; they emphasize the results of your efforts and draw clear parallels between your skills and experience and an employer s needs. The 5 Steps of Resume Development Step 1: Analyze the Position Description Read the position descriptions thoroughly and then highlight all of the keywords which indicate required and preferred skills, abilities, attributes, and qualifications. If an employer is looking for someone who is innovative, punctual, and attentive to detail, consider using these same or similar words in your resume. Because there are patterns within industries/fields, you may develop a strong resume template for a particular category of positions. Along these lines, it is also often appropriate to have multiple versions of your resume, which may vary in content and structure depending on your target. Step 2: Generate a List of Accomplishments Create an inventory of your accomplishments tasks you enjoyed doing, did well, and are proud of. Include education/ training, volunteer experience, jobs, projects, travel, group or team activities, and skills. There is no one formula for what to include in a resume Your resume should uniquely reflect you! Focus on the outcomes of your efforts, including skills you have developed. Quantify your results if possible. Don t sell yourself short! Resumes are promotional tools. Step 3: Identify Relevant Skill Areas Frame your experience so it focuses on skills and achievements that are desirable for that particular position/field/industry. Make sure each accomplishment you list highlights a skill the employer is seeking, often listed in the position responsibilities and qualifications. Remember transferable skills, skills you ve developed that can be used in many different settings! If you are applying to your first position in a field/industry, consider in detail which skills you have developed (and how) from past experiences that may translate to this new environment. Step 4: Write Descriptive Phrases Using action verbs (see p. 18), write concise phrases to describe experiences that demonstrate your relevant skills. The accomplishments on your resume should ultimately be targeted to address an employer s needs. Do your best to place them in order of relevance with the most relevant information as close as possible to the top. Step 5: Choose a Format Within one page, aim to develop a focused, succinct marketing document that clearly communicates your value and relevant experience and skills. 15 career.berkeley.edu A chronological resume is the most commonly used resume format. Listing your experience in reverse chronological order (with the most recent experiences first), this resume format accommodates all industries and levels of experience, and is preferred by the majority of employers and on-campus recruiters. Because a chronological resume presents your experience from most recent (relevant) to least recent (relevant), this format works especially well for students and entry- to mid-level applicants to demonstrate a vertical career progression. See p. 19-24 for examples of effective chronological resumes. Although a chronological resume is often a safe bet for all levels, established professionals who have multiple gaps and/ or unusually large gaps in their employment history, who are aspiring to make a career change into a new industry, or who want to promote a specific skillset may consider a skills/functional resume format or a hybrid/combination resume format as alternatives to the chronological resume format. If appropriate, established professionals may also move beyond a one-page resume. While resume templates may be tempting, they tend to be inflexible; also, employers are often familiar with them and may perceive you as lacking ingenuity. Find a format that works for you, and use your own words to develop content that is unique to you. The Resume Bullet: How To Say It Resume bullets should describe your skills and accomplishments, reflecting the order or priority that the employer has stated in their position description and requirements. Write bullet points for jobs, internships, volunteer experiences and activities where you ve developed skills. Consider how these bullet points highlight skills and experiences that match the position requirements. Action-oriented statements highlighting your accomplishments should use concrete language and could include: What: What task (transferable skill) did you perform? Use action verbs! (See p. 18) Why: Why did you perform this task? e.g. to fulfill a goal, serve a need or make your organization/company better? How: Specifically how did you perform this task? What equipment, tool, software program, or method did you use to accomplish this task? Result: What was the positive result you achieved or impact you made by performing this task (quantitative or qualitative)? Adjectives: Spice it up with descriptors; sell yourself go for it! Examples: What: Created a brochure. What and How: Created a brochure using InDesign. What and Why: Created a brochure to generate customer interest in the company s new line of fall clothing. What, Why, and Result: Created a brochure to generate customer interest in the company s new line of fall clothing, resulting in high praise from Director of Marketing. Adding Adjectives: Created a colorful and eye-catching marketing brochure using InDesign to generate customer interest in the company s new line of fall clothing, resulting in high praise from Director of Marketing. What: Tutored students. What and How: Tutored students using a variety of methods to adjust to different learning styles. What and Why: Tutored students to help them retain information and improve both grades and overall performance in Math and English. What, Why, and Result: Tutored students to help them improve grades and overall performance; saw marked improvement over a three-month period in 100% of students. Adding Adjectives: Tutored at-risk youth in Math and English; assessed learning styles of each student and creatively adjusted tutoring style based on results. Affected information retention and overall grade improvement in 100% of students tutored over a three month period. Acknowledged by Director for strong commitment to student success.

Technical skills Source: Job Outlook 2016, National Association of Colleges and Employers RESUME TIPS FOR FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS You may include work, leadership, and academic achievements from high school. By your third year in college, more recent experiences should replace those from high school. Don t worry about having limited work experience. Instead focus on transferable skills developed through other kinds of involvement or accomplishments. Your first college resume may require extra time to assemble. Expect to spend a few hours creating a rough draft, and make an appointment with a Career Counselor or see a Peer Advisor to review your document. Be patient with the process!

A CV should then be tailored to the position you are applying for by ordering your sections from most to least relevant Use your CV as a professional archive and keep it updated with all your accomplishments Tip: Consider consulting with a faculty member or advisor for advice and feedback on your CV because they often serve on hiring committees and have experienced an academic job search. TO GET STARTED WITH YOUR RESUME OR CV: Make a list of your experiences: Education, research, teaching, publications/presentations, organizations, etc. Think about your contributions, skills you used and developed, and your significant achievements Begin to craft your resume or CV by organizing these experiences into sections (examples below) There are many sections that could be a part of your document. It is important to keep in mind that your document should be specific to your experience and the position for which you are applying. You have flexibility in the choice, naming, and placement of sections. While your contact information and education are usually listed first, other sections can be in any order, based on your strengths and the requirements of the position or opportunity. If you are unsure if you should provide a resume or a CV, you may want to contact the organization directly to see which they prefer. RESUME AND CV SECTIONS Below is a list of common sections you may use when creating your document. To see examples of these sections, refer to the example resume and CV at the end of this guide. __________________________________________________________________________________________________________ CONTACT INFORMATION: Include your name, present and/or permanent address, telephone number, and email address. __________________________________________________________________________________________________________ SUMMARY OF QUALIFICATIONS: Included on a resume, a set of bullet points (skills statements) that concisely highlight skills and experiences on your resume that relate directly to the position. __________________________________________________________________________________________________________ EDUCATION: Include all institutions of higher education you have attended and are currently attending in reverse-chronological order (most recent first).

Also include the completion date. Page 1 EXPERIENCE: For each experience (paid or volunteer) include your position title, organization name and location, and dates of employment. Then create bulleted skills statements to describe your experience using this formula: Action Verb + Details + Result (when applicable). To format skills statements, begin with a bullet point, then use an action verb (see pg. 4 for list) that describes the skill used (e.g. created, researched, etc.) and summarize your duties, accomplishments, and projects. When possible describe the results of your efforts. Example of skills statement: Demonstrates teamwork Weak Skills Statement: Manufactured diagnostic reagents Strong Skills Statement: Collaborated in a team of 15 to efficiently manufacture diagnostic reagents in a GMP environment Avoid using personal pronouns such as I and make sure verbs are in the correct tense (past tense for past experiences and present tense for current experiences). List your experiences in reverse chronological order (most recent first). Consider creating specific experience sections to highlight different types of experiences, such as Related Experience, Research Experience, Leadership Experience, etc. __________________________________________________________________________________________________________ TEACHING/RESEARCH EXPERIENCE: Teaching experiences include information such as courses taught, university and department names, dates, and a description.

It can also be helpful to provide a brief statement describing your relationship with each reference. If included along with a resume, references are on a separate page that is formatted to match your resume. If included as part of your CV, references may be placed at the end of the document. Page 2 TRANSFERABLE SKILLS: As you begin your search for a career and/or job, it is important to know your qualifications and communicate these skills to an employer through your resume, cover letter, and interview. Over the years you have developed many skills through your coursework, extracurricular activities, and life experiences. Review the list below and identify which transferrable skills you have and reflect on how you acquired these skills. Use this information when creating your resume to describe your experiences and the skills gained from these experiences. For example, if you have researched a topic for class and then wrote, edited, and presented a final research paper in front of your peers, you have used skills (gathering information, writing, problem-solving, presenting) which are not limited to that specific academic discipline, but are transferable to many occupations. Research and planning Human relations Organizing, management and leadership Work survival The skillful expression and interpretation of knowledge and ideas. The search for specific knowledge and the ability to conceptualize future needs and solutions. The use of interpersonal skills for resolving conflict, relating to and helping people. Ability to supervise and guide individuals and groups in the completion of goals. The daily skills that assist in promoting effective production and work satisfaction. Speaking effectively Predicting Developing relationships Initiating new ideas Implementing decisions Writing effectively Creating theories and ideas Being sensitive Handling details Cooperating Identifying problems Listening Coordinating tasks Enforcing policies Imagining alternatives Conveying feelings Managing groups Being punctual Identifying resources Providing support Delegating responsibility Managing time Gathering information Motivating Teaching Solving problems Sharing credit Perceiving non-verbal messages Coaching Setting goals Counseling Advising Presenting information Extracting information Cooperating Promoting change Accepting responsibility Describing feelings Defining needs Delegating with respect Interviewing Developing evaluations Representing others Selling ideas or products Setting and meeting deadlines Editing Creating spreadsheets and databases Perceiving feelings, situations Decision making with others Organizing Communication Listening attentively Expressing ideas Facilitating discussions Negotiating Persuading Calculating results Asserting Attending to detail Meeting goals Enlisting help Making decisions Managing conflict Page 3 ACTION VERBS: Action verbs are an effective way to begin a skills statement. They help to catch the readers attention and demonstrate both technical and transferable skills you have used in your experiences.

Generally a graduate resume should be 2-3 full pages and a CV should be 3-5 pages long. However, based on your experiences, career field, and the position description, it could be longer or shorter. Whatever the case, only print your document on one side of the paper and include your name and the page number at the top of each page. Avoid using a resume or CV template. This decreases your ability to personalize and make changes as your document evolves. Your resume or CV should be well organized, without spelling errors, and easy to read. An employer spends a short amount of time reading your document it is imperative that the employer clearly sees the most important qualifications. To organize your document, you may choose to use bold, italics, all caps, indenting, and bullets. You will want to use these sparingly to emphasize the most important information. Avoid pictures, graphics, non-black ink, shading, and symbols instead of traditional, round, solid bullet points. It is a good idea to start with a 1-inch margin on each side. You can expand the margins if need be. Font size should be between 10-12 point, and you will want to choose easy to read font styles, such as Times New Roman, Arial, or Garamond. Keep font size and style consistent throughout your CV (except for your name, which should be a larger size). Present your resume or CV on quality bond paper (20 pound) choose white or off-white to ensure your document is easy to read. If you are filling out an online application where you cannot upload your document directly, keep the format simple when filling in required information. If you are requested to submit your documents via email, save your resume or CV and cover letter (if applicable) as attachments. Include a brief note in the body of the email stating your purpose. TIPS FOR RESUME AND CV WRITING: Make sure that your resume or CV is a unique and personal document. It is a great idea to look at examples of resumes or CVs but also important to make it your own. There are some suggestions that we provide when writing a resume or CV, but there are also options and room for choice. If you give your document to several people, they may all give you different feedback. Beyond some of our strongly suggested guidelines, resumes and CVs are subjective. Be 100% honest and factual. Avoid abbreviations. Organize your document so the most important information is at the top. Do not include a work history. Rather, include your most related experiences or those where you demonstrated a high level of skill. Personal information, such as marital status, age, ethnicity, height, and weight should not be included. Avoid personal pronouns (I, my, we) and complete sentences to describe your experiences. Start your statements with action verbs. Always proofread your resume or CV. Do not solely rely on spell check. Some employers may eliminate candidates based on errors. It is suggested that you tailor your resume or CV to the job description. You may have more than one version of your document depending on the positions to which you are applying . You may change the order of sections to list more relevant areas of your experience closer to the top. Remember that your resume or CV is YOUR marketing tool. Many times it is an employer s first impression of you. It is also a work in progress that you will continually revise.

On average, administrators spend less than 30 seconds screening it, so it is essential for your resume to project a clear and concise picture. The purpose of a resume is to market your education-related skills, experiences, and achievements so that you obtain an interview, therefore you should tailor your resume to the position you want. Formatting Tips There are no set rules regarding how to format your resume, however there are general guidelines you can follow when writing your resume. Ultimately you are encouraged to pick the format that best highlights your skills and accomplishments. LENGTH: Education majors typically use a 2 page resume as there are a number of requirements and experiences education students acquire and those should be documented on your resume. PAGE NUMBERS: Always include Your Name, Page 2 on the second page of your resume, in case it gets separated from the first. PRIORITIZE: Place your most important information toward the top of the resume. You may want your first section to be titled Teaching Experience , where you would then include your student teaching positions. PROOFREAD: Check and recheck for spelling and grammatical errors. Have Career & Professional Development, as well as someone in the teaching profession, review your resume and provide feedback. FORMAT: Start with a blank Word document. You may want to start by making a list of all of your experiences, certifications, accomplishments. Avoid using templates because they may not allow you to easily move information or change bullets, fonts, or text sizes. PRINTING: Print your resume on quality, white, grey or off-white paper. SAVE: If e-mailing your resume, use your name when saving the document. Be sure to save your resume in multiple locations. PERSONAL INFORMATION: Do not include a photograph or other personal information such as age, weight, height, marital status. FONT: Use easy to read fonts (Ex: Times New Roman, Arial, Calibri, Cambria, etc.). Keep font sizes between 10 point and 12 point. MARGINS: Keep margin widths between .5 and 1 . Heading REQUIRED CONTENT Name: Make sure your name stands out by using a larger font (16-22 point font) and bolding it. Address & phone number o Include only one phone number and use a professional outgoing message on your phone (e.g. You have reached the voicemail of Julie Fox, I am sorry I missed your call. Please leave your name, number and brief message and I will return your call as soon as possible. Thanks.). o Include a campus and a permanent address if you will be in different locations during your search. E-mail address: A combination of your first and last name keeps your e-mail address professional (your SNC e-mail is good forever); remove the hyperlink. OPTIONAL CONTENT Personal website/LinkedIn public profile: Include personal websites only if they are directly related to your objective and will enhance your candidacy. You may consider creating your own online portfolio to highlight your subject area, classroom management plan, strong lesson plans, sample letters, pictures of a well-organized classroom in which you worked.

First Avenue Stanley, WI 54768 Dear Ms. Gonzales: Where all students learn at a high level, was the first thing I was drawn to while reviewing your website. One sentence, packed with a great deal of meaning. The strides Stanley-Boyd has made in math and reading to achieve 90% of your students passing their reading tests and 83% proficient or advanced in Math is something of which I hope to be a part. It is for these reasons I would love the opportunity to join your community as a 2nd grade teacher. In May 2013 I will be graduating from St. Norbert College in De Pere, Wisconsin with a Bachelors of Arts degree in Elementary Education and a minor in Language Arts. My strengths in building connections with students, faculty and parents, using technology to effectively enhance the classroom, and differentiate instruction based on the needs of my students are just a few of things I can offer to Stanley-Boyd. Some of the ways I build strong relationships with students, faculty, and parents is through attending after school events, participating in a district meeting, and opening lines of communication via newsletters, e-mails, phone calls, and conferences. Two additional strengths I possess are the ability to use technology effectively and differentiate and engage students. For example, with my first grade students I used iPads during guided reading where high leveled students spelled sight words, middle leveled students read sight words, and lower leveled students traced letters while practicing letter sounds. Another example is in 8th grade advanced Language Arts where students read a novel regarding utopias. Students then reflected on their own utopia, wrote about it, and then presented using WebPages, movies, or podcast. Finally, at the end of the year students reflected on the unit choosing their favorite piece; many chose to write about the technology. I am excited about this opportunity to join your team of educators, and bring my various strengths with me. I would love to assist Stanley-Boyd Elementary School in the continuation of being a spotlight school. Thank you for considering my qualifications for this 2nd grade position, I look forward to hearing from you in the near future to discuss my qualifications. If you would like to contact me, I can be reached at (920) 337-5555 or sam.knight@snc.edu. Again, I look forward to this great opportunity at Stanley-Boyd. Go Orioles!

William and Flora Hewlett Foundation (2006-2007) Summary of Research and Scholarship: I am a sociologist of higher education. Through research, writing, and teaching, I have contributed to our understanding of major changes in the academic landscape and organizational character of American higher education. My work illuminates the dynamics of institutional change in several arenas what facilitates it and what impedes it within different types of colleges and universities and identifies implications for academic leaders who manage organizational change, knowledge change and professional socialization. Using theories and methods from sociology, I analyze how organizational, intellectual, political, economic, and professional interests redefine the content, structure, conduct, and relative legitimacy of academic fields. Key studies include: the emergence and institutionalization of interdisciplinary fields; dynamics of professional socialization across disciplines; tensions in restructuring during budget cuts and selective investment; the ascendance of industry logic in public higher education (1975-2000), a pivotal era of changing societal expectations; forces that promote and inhibit academic collaboration. Serving in academic leadership roles has affirmed my passion for these areas and has inspired new inquiry in graduate education, leadership development, academic collaboration, and organizational change. 2 PUBLICATIONS Books Gumport, P.

The cover letter introduces you and your resume to the reader, and the resume gives a more complete overview of your experience and qualifications. Together, these important marketing tools show where the match is between you and the position description and determine if you ll be interviewed. Your resume and cover letter must be geared to your audience. Before you start writing: Assess yourself. Know what skills and experience you bring to the table. Come talk! Research the field so you can use its keywords in your resume and cover letters, important whether your docs are being scanned by computer or read by a person. Consult our guide, Your Job Search. Analyze the description of position for which you re applying. Notice the key skills and competencies the employer seeks. Identify specific examples in your resume that match these qualifications and stress these in your letter. Guidelines on cover letter writing begin on page 6. Getting Started on Your Resume Whether writing your first resume or updating a previous one, it may help to begin with a master list of all your jobs, internships, campus and community activities, special courses and projects, schools attended, interests, travel, and skills. All this will not end up in your final resume, but you want to be sure you don t leave out anything important. A professional resume is likely very different from your college application version. Length One page is standard for most fields and for most students and recent graduates. This is especially important for business, technology, or communications firms (advertising or publishing, for example). Employers in many other fields appreciate a concise and attractive one-page resume. A longer resume is appropriate for certain applicants and fields. For teaching, a two-page resume is acceptable if you have significant related experience. For fellowships, grants, or research jobs, you may need a Curriculum Vitae, or C.V. A resume for federal jobs is often longer than one page. Speak with a career advisor if you have any questions about what format is appropriate for your needs. Format Avoid templates or resume wizards. Your goal is to have your resume stand out in a positive way, and template resumes often appear identical to those of many other applicants. Arrange your education and experience in reverse chronological order, present to past. This lets your reader easily see your current and recent background. You may also use categories relevant to your audience, for example, Public Relations Experience, Laboratory Experience, and so forth. Some fields require specialized resume formats. A C.V. may be needed for research, science positions, or fellowships. For C.V. guidelines, please see Curriculum Vitae for Academic or Research Roles. Acting, performance, or studio arts majors should consult Resumes for Actors and Artists. Note that many U.S. employers asking for a C.V. may actually want a resume. 2 Writing a Resume Employers Will Read Use action verb phrases to describe your experiences. Instead of Responsibilities included training staff say Trained five new staff. A list of action verbs is on page 5. Be concise; omit personal pronouns and a, an, and the whenever possible. Instead of I created and maintained a database using Excel, say Created and maintained database using Excel. Stress accomplishments and results; quantify your results when appropriate. For example: Draft #1: Waited tables. Opened and closed restaurant. Draft #2: Provided customer service to patrons of high-traffic caf . Opened and closed restaurant. Draft #3: Provided quality customer service to patrons of high-traffic caf , serving up to 100 meals during busy lunch and dinner shifts. Developed loyal return clientele. Selected by manager over more experienced wait staff to open and close restaurant. Totaled up to $200 in tips per shift. Create different resumes for different audiences. All fields have different keywords and expectations of resumes. If possible, have it reviewed by a professional in your field as well as the Lazarus Center. Make it clear. Avoid confusing acronyms and abbreviations. Instead of S.O.S., say Service Organizations of Smith. It s OK to use postal abbreviations for states, but be consistent. Sections of a Resume NAME. Put it at the top, centered or flush left. Use caps, bold, and a larger font to make it stand out. CONTACT INFORMATION. List your current address, phone, and email on one line (saves space) or blocked. Also list a permanent or forwarding address if it s in your search region. OBJECTIVE (optional). We suggest you omit an objective from your resume and state it in your cover letter. SUMMARY or PROFILE (optional). More experienced applicants may begin with a summary geared to the reader. For example: Five years communications and marketing experience in non-profit sector. Skilled researcher, writer, and editor. Excellent public speaking and workshop facilitation skills. Strong fundraising background with special expertise in grant writing. Experience recruiting, training, and motivating volunteers. EDUCATION generally comes first for students and recent grads. From present to past, list school, location, degree, date awarded or expected, major, minor, and concentration. Study away, other degrees, thesis, related courses, projects, and research papers may be included. GPA is required for finance or consulting but optional for other fields. If your combined SAT is 2100+, we suggest including it on a finance resume. List major and cumulative GPA if you like. High school experience is often included by first years and sophomores. Others may include it if relevant, for example, if you re searching in the region where you attended high school or if you had significant high school experience related to your objective. HONORS and AWARDS, if you have them, may go under Education or as a separate category. 3 SKILLS can include languages, computer or lab skills, equipment use, and other skills relevant to your reader. Include skills under Education or as a separate category. Add relevant licensing and certifications. EXPERIENCE can include jobs, internships, volunteering, extracurricular activities, and course projects. From present to past, list title, organization, location, and dates. (Put organizations first, titles second if you like, but do so consistently.) Use specific titles such as Administrative Intern, rather than Intern, if your supervisor approves. Choose headers stressing experience in your target field, for example, Museum Experience. ADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE (also called Supporting Experience) is an optional category for content you d like to include but is less directly relevant to your reader. You may use a second heading as described above. ACTIVITIES, INTERESTS, SKILLS, TRAVEL, AFFILIATIONS. Choose headings that work for the rest of your content. Be specific. Say Enjoy modern British fiction rather than Enjoy reading. Listing memberships that reveal your race, ethnicity, religion, political affiliation, sexual orientation, or gender identity may encourage or discourage employers from interviewing you. Feel free to consult a career advisor about your resume content. DO NOT INCLUDE the statement References Available on Request. Instead, prepare a separate page titled References for Your Name with your references names, titles, and contact info (with permission) to send if requested. Personal statistics (age, height, weight) and a photograph are only appropriate for a performance resume. Marital status is never included on a resume. INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS WISHING TO WORK IN THE US should use their Smith address and/or a US address if you have one rather than an international address. Do not include your current visa status or country of citizenship. It is illegal for employers to ask about these topics in the US, though they may ask whether you have work authorization or will require visa sponsorship in the future. If you are a Permanent Resident we suggest including this in a final Activities and Additional Background section. Questions? Please see a career advisor about your resume and the international student advisor about work status regulations. Making Your Resume Attractive and Easy to Read Select a font size and style that are easy to read. We suggest 10-12 point size in familiar fonts such as Arial, Times New Roman, or Garamond. Try a slightly larger font for headings and name. Adjust the margins to fit your content. 1.0 margins are typical, but not a strict requirement. Use capital letters, bold type, italics, underlining, bullets, and spacing for emphasis. Be consistent with spacing, dates, punctuation, and order of information. Details matter! Proofread your resume carefully. Don t rely on spell check. Misspellings, grammar and punctuation errors, and inconsistencies make a poor first impression. You may not be asked for an interview as a result. For hard copy resumes, use bond paper (24 # weight is suggested) in white, cream, or gray. Use the same paper for your letters and get matching envelopes. If using a watermarked paper, get the mark right-side up. Use a letter quality printer with a fresh cartridge. Keep your resume polished and up-to-date. Revise it as you gain new experiences or change directions. The effort you put into this important marketing tool will be time well spent. . 4 Action Verb List The verbs listed below are only a few of the many you can use in describing your experience and accomplishments. Make sure you have an action verb for each entry in your resume Experience section. accelerated conceived encouraged interpreted produced simplified accomplished conducted enlisted introduced programmed solved achieved delegated established launched promoted specialized adapted demonstrated estimated led proposed stimulated adjusted designed evaluated lectured proved streamlined aided determined examined listed provided structured allocated developed expanded maintained ran substituted amplified devised expedited managed received suggested analyzed devoted extended modified recommended summarized answered diagnosed fabricated molded reconciled supervised applied diagrammed focused monitored recorded supported appointed directed forecast motivated recruited systematized approved distributed fortified negotiated reduced teamed arbitrated collaborated founded observed re-established trained arranged constructed generated operated regulated treated assisted consulted guided orchestrated rehearsed tutored assumed contracted handled organized reinforced unified attained contrived harmonized oriented renegotiated updated augmented controlled headed originated reorganized used awarded cooperated implemented oversaw reported utilized began coordinated improved overhauled researched volunteered brought counseled incorporated participated reshaped widened built created increased performed restored wrote calculated dealt influenced persuaded revamped catalogued defined initiated planned reviewed chaired edited inspected pinpointed revised compared effected installed prepared scheduled compiled eliminated instituted presented selected completed employed instructed preserved set up 5 Cover Letters: The First Impression An employer s first impression of you is often your cover letter, so it must engage their attention quickly and convince them to take the time to read your resume. Your cover letter needs to show what makes you a great fit for the position. It is not sufficient to say you have the skills required for the position or are interested in it. First, research the field and organization. Go beyond the website use press releases, journal/news articles, annual reports, Google, LexisNexis, and informational interviews with alums and others. Knowledge of the organization shows your initiative and enthusiasm for working there. Review the job description; notice the skills sought and field-specific terms used. Identify specific examples from your resume that demonstrate how you ve used the skills the employer wants. Stress accomplishments and results rather than simply listing your day-to-day responsibilities. Whenever possible, address your letter to an actual person, not To Whom it May Concern.Phone or email to get the recipient s name and title if it s not included in the position description. If you can get a name, use a title such as Dear Directoror Dear Internship Coordinator.The cover letter is a sample of your writing and communication skills. It must be clear, concise, and free of spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors. Keep it simple. Dense, academic language or slang are inappropriate this is a business letter. Tailor each cover letter. Employers may receive dozens or even hundreds of applications for any given position. Careful research, relevant examples, and specific reasons why this position and this organization interest you will help distinguish your application. Framing Your Story: Questions to Guide Your Cover Letter Use the following to generate content for your cover letter. Though it need not answer every question, a great letter will address many of these items and show you ve considered the others: Why are you interested in this position? This organization? This field/industry? For what position are you applying? What do you know about the organization, its work, clients/customers/products that especially interests you? What do you feel distinguishes this organization from its peers? What specific skills and knowledge is the employer seeking for this position? How have your prior experiences influenced your interest in this position/organization/field? In what ways have your accomplishments during your prior experiences (extracurricular, volunteer, work, other) prepared you to excel in this position? What aspects of your academic experience will help you succeed in this position? Compared to other applicants, how might you be uniquely qualified for the position? How will the organization benefit from hiring you? Having difficulty answering any of these questions? Revisiting the job description, further research, and clarifying your skills and interests may help. 6 Cover Letter Format Use standard business letter format for your letter. Refer to the following page for guidelines on address format, greeting and closing, and spacing. A cover letter should be no more than one page. Keep the paragraphs short and easy to read. Use a 10-12 point font size in the same font style as your resume. Set the margins so the letter is visually balanced on the page (1 is standard). For hard copy applications, use matching resume-weight paper and envelopes, and sign your letter in black ink. If using stationery with a watermark, be sure it is facing the correct way. Emailing Cover Letters and Resumes Always follow an employer s preference when emailing your resume and cover letter. If you don t know an employer s preference, send your resume and letter as attached PDFs labeled with your name (ex: Jane Doe resume.). In the subject line say Resume and cover letter for children s trade division editorial assistant position (#498). If sending your letter as an attachment, make the email message short: Dear Ms. Nunez: I am a senior English major at Smith College with administrative and publications experience interested in the children s trade division editorial assistant position (#498) advertised on bookjobs.com. The attached cover letter and resume provide details about my background and strong interest in Cricket Hill Press. Please let me know if you have difficulty opening the attachments. I look forward to discussing this position with you. Sincerely, Jane Doe Before emailing your documents to employers, email them to yourself and a couple of friends. This gives you a chance to address any technical or format problems. How the Lazarus Center Can Help Feel free to bring your resume or cover letter to a 15-minute drop-in appointment. If you re currently away from Smith, you may get feedback on your resume and cover letter during a phone or Skype appointment. 7 COVER LETTER FORMAT Date Note: One inch margins are typical.

With strong interests in youth development and team sports, I am drawn to this position as an opportunity to make a positive difference in the lives of inner city youth. I have extensive experience working with children in athletic and arts settings. As Assistant Coach of the Marion County Youth Softball League, I designed non-competitive beginner practices that motivated each player to strive for her personal best. As the girls skill level, self-esteem, and teamwork grew, several reported having greater success in school. Previously, as Arts Leader for Fine Arts for Kids in Miami, I taught arts and crafts to Hispanic youth and initiated cost-free activities that enriched their appreciation of art. As public schools are increasingly cutting funding for arts and sports programs, I am eager to help close the gap for these children however I can. As a teacher/coach with REAL Kids/Harlem RBI I hope to share with my students the important lessons about teamwork, leadership, and motivation I ve learned from softball. I owe my academic success in large part to the committed coaches I had since joining my first softball team at age six. I am excited by the prospect of inspiring your students to play, learn, and grow this summer. I am available at your convenience for an in-person or phone interview, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

I would be excited to bring my experience in marketing, background in music performance, and love of symphonic music to this opportunity.

I first experienced the power of live performance while attending The Philadelphia Orchestra s summer series at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center in upstate New York where I grew up. Wolfgang Sawallisch s famed all-Wagner concerts and interpretations of the Bruckner symphonies instilled in me a passion for music that continues to this day. The Marketing Intern position interests me as an opportunity to contribute my marketing savvy and love of live symphony while learning about the business side of the arts.

I was excited to read your ad since I have had a long-time interest in pharmaceutical sales and your products sound particularly appealing to me. As a college student, I had the opportunity to experience in sales and customer service. Of particular interest to you, I worked at Glassboro Medical Supply serving customers who enter our store. Through reading professional periodicals and magazines that are sent to me as an employee of Glassboro Medical Supply, I have become knowledgeable of the different types of medical supplies. This knowledge enables me to fully address our customers medical supply needs and answer their questions. Utilizing my proactive approach to sales and customer service, I increased sales this year by 20% over last year s figures. In light of my accomplishment, my supervisor has given me the responsibility of developing a plan to market medical supplies to local drug stores. In addition to my work experience, I recently completed a course in drug/pharmacology terminology at the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia. Completion of this course increased my knowledge of medicines and their effects. I have always had a strong interest in the medical/pharmaceutical sales field and have attempted to gain the knowledge and experience needed to work effectively in that capacity.

Current Research: American Government: Democracy in Transition (Pearson, under contract) This book examines the American political system and its institutions as we transform from a democracy of self-interest to one of increasing transparency and evidence-based decision making. The book is designed for introductory American Government courses, and therefore covers, in depth, the framers, constitutional theory, institutions, and participation while simultaneously engaging with a student population who may be only vaguely interested in government. Linking Science to Decision Making in Environmental Policy: Bridging the Disciplinary Gap (coauthored with Lawrence Becker, The MIT Press, under contract) This book examines the role of science in moderating interest-based politics in resource management and environmental stewardship. The manuscript builds a model of science based policy processes where management decisions are based on stakeholder input but constrained by scientific efficacy. Ultimately, the project is intended to develop a protocol to maximize crossdisciplinary decision making in environmental policy. Environmental Deceptions: The Tension between Liberalism and Environmental Policymaking in the United States (with Kristy Michaud; Albany: State University of New York Press, 2nd edition under contract) This book brings together normative analyses and empirical data to explain the structural limitations liberal society places on environmental improvement. I argue that cultural ambivalence toward communitarian ethics has made the traditional environmental infrastructure problematic. The book exposes the subtle tensions that often lead to policy failure, and suggests that traditional policy models are insufficient to resolve existing environmental dilemmas in air, water, waste, and energy.

On average, administrators spend less than 30 seconds screening it, so it is essential for your resume to project a clear and concise picture. The purpose of a resume is to market your education-related skills, experiences, and achievements so that you obtain an interview, therefore you should tailor your resume to the position you want. Formatting Tips There are no set rules regarding how to format your resume, however there are general guidelines you can follow when writing your resume. Ultimately you are encouraged to pick the format that best highlights your skills and accomplishments. LENGTH: Education majors typically use a 2 page resume as there are a number of requirements and experiences education students acquire and those should be documented on your resume. PAGE NUMBERS: Always include Your Name, Page 2 on the second page of your resume, in case it gets separated from the first. PRIORITIZE: Place your most important information toward the top of the resume. You may want your first section to be titled Teaching Experience , where you would then include your student teaching positions. PROOFREAD: Check and recheck for spelling and grammatical errors. Have Career & Professional Development, as well as someone in the teaching profession, review your resume and provide feedback. FORMAT: Start with a blank Word document. You may want to start by making a list of all of your experiences, certifications, accomplishments. Avoid using templates because they may not allow you to easily move information or change bullets, fonts, or text sizes. PRINTING: Print your resume on quality, white, grey or off-white paper. SAVE: If e-mailing your resume, use your name when saving the document. Be sure to save your resume in multiple locations. PERSONAL INFORMATION: Do not include a photograph or other personal information such as age, weight, height, marital status. FONT: Use easy to read fonts (Ex: Times New Roman, Arial, Calibri, Cambria, etc.). Keep font sizes between 10 point and 12 point. MARGINS: Keep margin widths between .5 and 1 . Heading REQUIRED CONTENT Name: Make sure your name stands out by using a larger font (16-22 point font) and bolding it. Address & phone number o Include only one phone number and use a professional outgoing message on your phone (e.g. You have reached the voicemail of Julie Fox, I am sorry I missed your call. Please leave your name, number and brief message and I will return your call as soon as possible. Thanks.). o Include a campus and a permanent address if you will be in different locations during your search. E-mail address: A combination of your first and last name keeps your e-mail address professional (your SNC e-mail is good forever); remove the hyperlink. OPTIONAL CONTENT Personal website/LinkedIn public profile: Include personal websites only if they are directly related to your objective and will enhance your candidacy. You may consider creating your own online portfolio to highlight your subject area, classroom management plan, strong lesson plans, sample letters, pictures of a well-organized classroom in which you worked.

First Avenue Stanley, WI 54768 Dear Ms. Gonzales: Where all students learn at a high level, was the first thing I was drawn to while reviewing your website. One sentence, packed with a great deal of meaning. The strides Stanley-Boyd has made in math and reading to achieve 90% of your students passing their reading tests and 83% proficient or advanced in Math is something of which I hope to be a part. It is for these reasons I would love the opportunity to join your community as a 2nd grade teacher. In May 2013 I will be graduating from St. Norbert College in De Pere, Wisconsin with a Bachelors of Arts degree in Elementary Education and a minor in Language Arts. My strengths in building connections with students, faculty and parents, using technology to effectively enhance the classroom, and differentiate instruction based on the needs of my students are just a few of things I can offer to Stanley-Boyd. Some of the ways I build strong relationships with students, faculty, and parents is through attending after school events, participating in a district meeting, and opening lines of communication via newsletters, e-mails, phone calls, and conferences. Two additional strengths I possess are the ability to use technology effectively and differentiate and engage students. For example, with my first grade students I used iPads during guided reading where high leveled students spelled sight words, middle leveled students read sight words, and lower leveled students traced letters while practicing letter sounds. Another example is in 8th grade advanced Language Arts where students read a novel regarding utopias. Students then reflected on their own utopia, wrote about it, and then presented using WebPages, movies, or podcast. Finally, at the end of the year students reflected on the unit choosing their favorite piece; many chose to write about the technology. I am excited about this opportunity to join your team of educators, and bring my various strengths with me. I would love to assist Stanley-Boyd Elementary School in the continuation of being a spotlight school. Thank you for considering my qualifications for this 2nd grade position, I look forward to hearing from you in the near future to discuss my qualifications. If you would like to contact me, I can be reached at (920) 337-5555 or sam.knight@snc.edu. Again, I look forward to this great opportunity at Stanley-Boyd. Go Orioles!

A description of your past experiences, paid or volunteer, arranged in reverse chronological order in addition to your educational history, campus activities, interests and skills are intended to entice the reader to talk with you. The example resumes in this guide will help you choose effective formatting and layout styles, but you still may wish to sit down one-on-one with a Career Advisor to help decide what content to include in your resume. For individual assistance, contact Career Services to set up an appointment at 419.530.4341. Below are some general suggestions to help get you started: If you choose to utilize an objective, include the grade levels and/or subjects you are prepared to teach and list a few important skills you have to offer. To obtain a teaching position is not specific enough. Remember, you do not have to use an objective. List your Licensure (state, specific subjects and grade levels) near the top of your resume, either in the objective or under the Education section. Some people even choose to list it separately under its own Licensure section. List your experiences and organizational involvement in reverse chronological order the last thing you accomplished will be the first thing you list under each separate heading of your resume. Do not forget to list your methods and other field experiences they are important! When describing your related experiences, like student teaching, include the subjects, grade levels, and the number of students you taught. Use action words to describe your responsibilities (refer to the Action Word List on page 10 of the Career Services Resume Writing Guide). Do not list high school involvement on your resume, unless something you accomplished in high school relates directly to your career goals (i.e., if you wish to coach basketball, and you played varsity basketball for three years in high school as well as volunteering as an assistant coach at a local YMCA, you will want to include that experience). Do not list hobbies unless they relate directly to your career goals. Your resume is a professional document avoid cute email address names, papers with colored borders, pictures of you or your classroom, or anything that does not project a professional teaching image. Using high quality resume paper is a must. You want an employer to be dazzled by your experience and accomplishments, not distracted. If you need to, it is okay to use two pages for your resume. Just be sure that you have at least a half page of information on page two, put your name at the top in small print, and number it so that if the pages are separated they can be matched up again. List your references in a separate document, with your name and contact information at the top. School Address: 333 S.

It may also serve as a professional objective or personal statement. Keep in mind, the reviewer uses it as a writing sample as well grammar and spelling errors will give a negative impression concerning your attention to detail and professional image. The following cover letter examples provide guidelines concerning effective format and layout styles. Career Services encourages you to schedule an appointment with a Career Advisor to help you develop a unique cover letter that showcases your individual experience and strengths. Contact Career Services to set up an appointment at 419.530.4341. Keep these points in mind as you sit down to create your cover letter: If you would like to present a consistent, professional look with all of your job search correspondence, use the same heading (name/address/phone/email) on your cover letter that you created for the top of your resume. This becomes your own personal letterhead. If at all possible, address your cover letter to a specific person: superintendent, principal, human resource director, or other hiring official. If someone is referring you to a specific position, use that individual s name in the first paragraph to catch the reader s attention. Remember to convey confidence without seeming arrogant. To do this more effectively, focus on specific examples to illustrate your skills and abilities. Always remember to tell the employer what you can do for the organization, not what the school can do for you. Cover Letter Formula First Paragraph: State why you are writing by identifying the name of position you are Seeking and how you found out about it.

Resume Purpose, Design, & Mechanics .. ..Page 3 II. Key Elements of a Successful Resumes . ....Page 4 This document is intended to guide you in creating your resume by outlining important types of information to include and tips for doing so in a professional and persuasive manner. Please note this is not intended as a template and the format employed may or may not best represent you. Consider meeting with a Peer Career Advisor to discuss how you might best layout your own resume. III. Transferable Skills & Action Verbs .Page 5 Transferable skills are those that can be applied in a variety of industries and job functions. Considering which transferable skills you want to convey to employers is a great place to start when composing your resume. This list is a sampling of the types of skills you might highlight on your resume, in addition to those skills that are more specific to your major, intended industry, or job function. A sampling of action verbs is also included on this page. Be sure to use strong action verbs to begin each of your bulleted statements, previewing the skill to be exemplified through the accomplishment statement. IV. Chronological Resume Samples... ...Pages 6-11 In this most commonly accepted resume format, job titles and employers are emphasized, starting with your most recent experiences to illustrate a progressive work history. Your skills and accomplishments are described through bulleted statements under each position. This resume type is recommended for people who have recently graduated with a bachelor s degree, those who are staying within the same career field, and candidates with few time gaps in their job history. This type is most often preferred by employers because it is easy to scan, highlights job titles, employers, and dates, and clearly ties candidates skills and accomplishments to their work histories. V. Functional & Combination Resume Samples... ..Pages 12-13 This format is an option for candidates who have changed employers frequently, have gaps in their employment history, or are hoping to transition to a new industry or unrelated job function. Functional resumes enable candidates to highlight transferable skills, placing less emphasis on employment dates, job titles, and employers. VI. Additional Career Center Resume Resources ...Page 14 2 I. Resume Purpose, Design, & Mechanics The purpose of a resume is to market yourself to employers by succinctly summarizing your education, experience, and skills, ultimately aiming to convince employers to invite you to interview. When conceptualizing your resume, think of it as a marketing tool, rather than a simple work history, as it is intended to promote you as the perfect candidate for the opportunity at hand. Resume writing is an art, not a science. There is no one correct way to formulate a resume, but there are some best practices and standards that the Career Center recommends. Stand out from the crowd with high quality content and a clearly written, error-free document. Sequence the information from most important to least important with regard to your career objective. When constructing bullet points, aim to highlight accomplishments that exemplify the skills you possess and employers are seeking. Length: With a few rare exceptions, when applying for internships or entry-level jobs, students should keep their resume to 1 page. If you have difficulty narrowing down your resume, consider removing elements that are not closely related to the opportunities for which you are applying. Margins: Make your resume visually attractive. Use some whitespace to allow the reader s eye to rest. Using .5 inch to 1.5 inch margins is recommended. Font: Use a font that is easy to read. Times New Roman, Arial, and Courier New are good choices. A 10-12 point font size is recommended. Consistency: Keep the formatting consistent throughout your resume. For example, if you choose to bold a job title, make sure you bold every job title. Also, make sure that all of your bullet points, section headers, dates, etc. line up neatly on the page. Accuracy: Your resume, and all other job search materials, must be 100% error free. Be sure to carefully read through your resume, checking grammar, spelling, and punctuation. It is a good idea to have at least 2-3 people proofread it as well. Be Accomplishment-Orientated: Employers hire you for your skills and want to read about times when you have successfully utilized the skills they are seeking. Describe achievements, rather than listing duties, quantify outcomes whenever possible, and be sure to highlight your proficiency in both technical (industry or job function-specific) and transferable skills. Use Action Verbs: Strengthen your bullet points by beginning each with an action verb that previews the skill to be exemplified in that accomplishment statement. This allows a potential employer to more easily scan your resume for what he or she is seeking. Make it Clear and Be Succinct: Eliminate the pronoun I at the beginning of each bullet point as this is assumed. Avoid introductory and wind-up phrases such as My duties included... and My responsibilities were Overall Appearance: Ask yourself and others if your document is easy to read and professional looking. Also, consider that the average recruiter may scan your resume for 30 seconds or less. Make sure that your most important information stands out. 3 II. Key Elements of a Successful Resume Your First and Last Name Phone number Email address Street address City, state & zip code _______________________________________________________________________________________________________ OBJECTIVE Create a statement describing or naming the position you are seeking to obtain. You may also include the specific field or area you are interested in and the skills and expertise you could contribute to the company. This section is optional and could be omitted or substituted with a Career Highlights or Summary of Qualifications section. _______________________________________________________________________________________________________ EDUCATION Institution City, State (Expected) Graduation Month Year Write out the full name of your (expected) degree; also list Minors and Concentrations GPA: 4.0/4.0 (it is recommended that you include your GPA if it is 3.0 or higher) Other possible information to include: Study Abroad experiences, Relevant Coursework, or Academic Awards and Honors. _______________________________________________________________________________________________________ EXPERIENCE, RELEVANT EXPERIENCE, INTERNSHIP EXPERIENCE [possible titles/descriptive headings] Organization, Your Job Title City, State Month Year - Month Year The position header above is one example of formatting. Other formats can include using two lines or rearranging the order of the Organization, Job Title, Location, and Dates to emphasize the most important elements. You can bold or italicize your title or your organization whichever is more relevant, but be consistent. In this section include bulleted accomplishment statements, which provide examples of times you have successfully used the skills employers are seeking. Start with a strong action verb, then follow with an explanation of what you were doing, describe how you did it, and, when possible, include any outcomes that you achieved. Remember, statements should ultimately convey your proficiency in one or more skill sets of interest to the employer by way of providing an example of when you have used them. Consider the following questions to help you create more effective bullet points: What was the result/outcome of your work? What were your accomplishments? How did you help the organization? What skills/knowledge did you enhance? How does this experience relate to your internship/employment goal? Organization, Your Job Title City, State Month Year - Month Year Bulleted statements should be in the proper tense (past or present tense) and use consistent grammar and punctuation. Be specific by including quantity, frequency, population, and impact of your work whenever possible. Make sure your resume is easy to read and not too text heavy. Avoid using colors, multiple fonts, pictures, being too brief, or making it too dense. Make it your own, but be professional. _______________________________________________________________________________________________________ ADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE, LEADERSHIP, HONORS, ACTIVITIES, COMMUNITY SERVICE, VOLUNTEER, PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT [possible titles/descriptive headings] Organization, Your Job Title City, State Month Year - Month Year Using multiple experience sections is optional and allows you to emphasize (by placing it closer to the top) your most relevant experience. Experiences within a section should be listed in reverse chronological order. Positions within this section should be formatted like previous experience sections, but may or may not include bullet points. In an additional experience section, you can include work experiences that may not be directly related to the job you are applying to, but add to your credibility by exemplifying a progressive work history. Emphasize your transferable skills, those that can be taken from one experience and applied elsewhere. Organization, Your Role (e.g. Member, Participant, Honoree, or Presenter) City, State Month Year - Month Year This section can also be an opportunity to share your experiences as a leader, honors received, community involvement, professional development activities, or membership in organizations. As illustrated, replace job title with the role you played. Including bullet points is optional, depending on what you wish to convey to a potential employer. _______________________________________________________________________________________________________ ADDITIONAL SKILLS [List skills that are testable and concrete. Soft skills such as communication, organizational, and interpersonal skills should not be listed here, but rather incorporated into your bulleted accomplishment statements above.] Technology: Try to include programs that would not be assumed based on education and include your proficiency level. For example: Advanced User of Microsoft Office Suite, including Outlook, Excel, and PowerPoint, as well as Adobe Photoshop. Languages: For example: Proficient in oral and written German; Beginner knowledge of Spanish. 4 III. Transferable Skills & Action Verbs TRANSFERABLE SKILLS Transferable skills are those that can be applied in multiple work settings. Consider incorporating them, in addition to those that are specific to your intended career field, by providing examples of when you have successfully used them in your bulleted accomplishment statements. Some examples of transferable skills include the following: CLERICAL Bookkeeping Classifying Collecting Compiling Computing Examining Filing Organizing Recording Word processing CREATIVE Designing Developing Establishing Illustrating Imagining Improvising Inventing performing Revitalizing Visualizing HUMAN RELATIONS Advising Assisting Counseling Empathizing Facilitating Guiding Listening Motivating Representing Serving PUBLIC RELATIONS Conducting Consulting Informing Planning Presenting Promoting Representing Responding Researching Writing RESEARCH Assessing Calculating Collecting Diagnosing Evaluating Examining Extrapolating Interviewing Investigating Synthesizing COMMUNICATION Editing Explaining Influencing Interpreting listening Mediating Promoting Speaking Translating Writing FINANCIAL Accounting Administering Allocating Auditing Balancing Calculating Forecasting Investing Projecting MANAGEMENT Communicating Consulting Coordinating Delegating Directing Evaluating Leading Negotiating Persuading Planning PROBLEM SOLVING Analyzing Appraising Diagnosing Examining Executing Planning Proving Reasoning Recognizing Validating TECHNICAL Adjusting Aligning Assembling Drafting Engineering Installing Observing Operating Programming Repairing TRAINING Adapting Communicating Demonstrating Enabling Encouraging Evaluating Explaining Instructing Planning Stimulating ACTION VERBS Beginning each bulleted accomplishment statement with a strong action verb helps to highlight your successes and allows a reader to get a sense of your skills by scanning the page prior to reading each individual bullet point. It is a good idea to vary the action verbs on your resume in order to appeal to different audiences. Below is a list of verbs to help get you started.

{"index": "test", "type": "test", "id": 747, "body": {"body": "Automobile The Basics of a Legal Resume The goal of the legal resume is to get an interview. To do this, your resume must present clearly and concisely the reasons why you are a great candidate. In other words, the legal resume is persuasive writing. A good legal resume accomplishes three major tasks: To present your background and experience to emphasize how well you meet the requirements of the position. Which parts of your education, work and life experience are most pertinent to the job requirements? How should you describe them? If you have non-legal work experience, what experience should you include and how do you describe it to emphasize the skills that appeal to legal employers? To do so concisely and in an easy to read, proper legal format. Employers typically screen resumes in 30-60 seconds. A legal resume has a specific format that allows reviewers to see the most important information easily within this time frame. Review the Legal Resume Samples for examples. Legal resumes are typically one page, unless you have substantial professional experience, or the position requires a more detailed resume, such as an intellectual property or academic position. To convey a sense of who you are as an individual and as a potential employee. You can do this by including information on personal interests, community involvement, or other relevant experiences. Personal interests should be interesting to catch the reader s attention. This can often be a conversation starter in an interview and can help attorneys remember you as a candidate. Writing a Good Legal Resume You can simplify the process of writing the legal resume if you follow this approach: Brainstorm all the experiences you have had using the Law School Resume Worksheet, at the end of this publication. The next step is to list your skills, qualifications, and accomplishments. Update your resume as you continue to gain legal experiences, and on an annual basis after you graduate from law school. Read the qualifications preferred for the position. When you apply for a position, read the detailed job description to target your resume/cover letter as much as possible to match the employer s desired qualifications. Consider the overall appearance of your resume. Is the layout professional and easy to read? Is there enough white space? Is it free of grammar and spelling errors? Are the verb tenses consistent? Do the headers highlight your experience, such as, Legal Experience or Business Experience? Because templates restrict the resume s style/formatting and often do not highlight your information in the best way, we recommend that you avoid using resume templates. See the Legal Resume Samples (found in the Symplicity Document Library in the Symplicity Document Library) which demonstrate good examples of legal resumes. Be succinct in your writing style. Use short, dynamic, descriptive phrases rather than long sentences or paragraphs. Keep it to one or two pages, preferably one, unless you have extensive relevant experience. Begin sentences with action verbs. Examples of action verbs would be: drafted, organized, counseled, researched and evaluated. Stress skills, accomplishments, strengths and qualifications. Do not use the same verbs repeatedly to describe your experience. Check out the Action Verbs in the Symplicity Document Library for more suggestions. Draft the resume. Use these suggestions to help in this process. Remember, anything you put on your resume you may be asked about in an interview, so be sure it is accurate. Have a draft of your resume reviewed. By submitting your first resume in Symplicity, it will automatically be reviewed by career staff. You may schedule an appointment with a career advisor to review your resume. It may also be helpful to ask a mentor or professional in your job target area to review your resume for technical accuracy. Then, make your final revisions and proofread well. RESUME CONTENT The legal resume lists sections on education, legal and other experience, and may include other categories such as personal interests or community involvement. The main goal of your resume is to present the most relevant information about you within a limited space. HEADER Name, address, phone number, and email (preferably your Mitchell Hamline address). TIPS: Make sure the header is easy to read. Your name should be a large font size (14-16 pt). There are many ways to save space on your resume, for example: your phone number and email address can be written on one line in the header. Add a symbol (~ or other symbol) to separate your address, phone and email address. Remove the hyperlink in your email address by using a right click of the mouse. Make sure that your contact information (address, phone, and email) is current. Employers will use this information to contact you if they want to schedule an interview. Make sure that your voicemail messages and e-mail addresses are professional and that you check these on a regular basis. HEADER EXAMPLES: Susan A. Johnson 1122 Grand Avenue, St. Paul, MN 55105 651-699-1234 ~ susan.johnson@mitchellhamline.edu Susan A. Johnson______________________________________ 1122 Grand Avenue, St. Paul, MN 55105 651-699-1234 susan.johnson@mitchellhamline.edu EDUCATION List your college/university, city and state, and graduation year (not years attended). Include activities and honors from both undergraduate school and law school. List your GPA / Class Rank / and Top % of class, especially if you are participating in On-Campus Interviewing (OCI). EDUCATION ENTRY EXAMPLES: Mitchell Hamline School of Law, St. Paul, MN Juris Doctor expected, June 2018 G.P.A.: 2.97 Class Rank: 100/300 (Top 33.3%) Honors: Mitchell Hamline Law Review, Staff Member Vol. 40 Mitchell Hamline School of Law, St. Paul, MN Juris Doctor expected, June 2018 GPA: 3.32 Class Rank: 20/220 (Top 9.1%) Honors: CALI Award (highest grade in class) for Constitutional Law and Evidence; Dean s List (two semesters) Activities: International Law Student Organization; Student Bar Association, Section Representative Mitchell Hamline School of Law, St. Paul, MN Juris Doctor expected, June 2018 Dean s Honor Roll, 2 semesters International Law Student Organization Student Bar Association, Section Representative Gustavus Adolphus College, St. Peter, MN Bachelor of Arts, cum laude, Physics, G.P.A. 3.35, June 2014 Honors: Physics Department Award of Merit; All-Conference Soccer Team Activities: Physics Club (President); Varsity Soccer; Student Senate (Chair) Concordia College, Moorhead, MN Bachelor of Arts, magna cum laude, Business, May 2012 Honors: Dean s List (every semester); Merit-Based Academic Scholarships Activities: Student Senate Standards Board, Chair; Residence Hall Assistant; Intramural Volleyball TIPS: Spell out Degrees: Juris Doctor and Bachelor of Arts; magna cum laude and summa cum laude are Latin and written in italics with small letters (no capitals). Law Review: Mitchell Hamline Law Review (Staff member, 2016) Law Review should be written in italics (if using subheadings, list Law Review within you law school honors subsection). Grades and Class Rank: This should match what is on your transcript. Do not round your GPA or class rank to your advantage. A class rank of top 10.4% does not round up to top 10%, and a GPA of 2.9 is not a 3.0. Law School Activities: Legal employers are interested in seeing leadership roles you have held. List student organizations and any offices held or committee membership roles. Academic Honors: Include CALI Awards, Burton Awards, Dean s List and other selections. Include moot court/mock trial competitions and any honors you achieved (final competition team, best brief, etc.) List law journal membership, any publications, and offices held. Include scholarships awarded on the basis of merit. EXPERIENCE This section highlights your experience (paid or unpaid, including internships and volunteer experience) demonstrating your qualifications for the job. If you have one or more legal experiences, you may want to title this section Legal Experience. If you have extensive prior work experience, you may want to select titles that reflect your experience such as: Business Experience, Technical Experience, or Public Service Experience. Resumes may use either a bulleted or paragraph format. Bulleted points may be easier to read, but may take up more space. Always use strong action verbs to begin each phrase. Use the present tense for current jobs and past tense for previous jobs. Refer to the Action Verbs and Legal Resume Samples for further examples TIPS: Remember that volunteering for MJF, research assistantships with Mitchell Hamline professors, clinics, legal internships and externships are all legal experiences, as is work at a private law firm or other legal settings before and during law school. This work does not have to be paid work. Describe the kinds of legal issues and experiences you were involved in, the types of legal documents you wrote, the level of responsibility you had and the results accomplished. Do not merely list the job tasks. Make your work experience come alive with well chosen detail and description. For non-legal jobs, emphasize those aspects of your job that intersected with legal issues, such as: Negotiated contracts on _______ and provided clients with advice to obtain health care under complex federal, state and local regulations. Emphasize your transferable skills, for example, skills valued in the legal arena: Problem solving, oral and written communication, research and analysis in complex situations, client/customer service, and obtaining results. Whenever appropriate, and significant, use numbers and percentages to quantify accomplishments (for example: Supervised 12 employees; increased sales by 25%; managed budgets of $1-2 million). EXAMPLES: Lindquist & Vennum, P.L.L.P., Summer Associate, Minneapolis, MN, Summer 2015 Researched and drafted over 10 memoranda on legal issues, including lost profits, attorneys fees, credit loan participation, and liability of corporate officers for patent infringement. Drafted documents for marital dissolution, including interrogatories, requests for admission, affidavits and court briefs. Updated an arbitration clause for use in client contracts. Wells Fargo N.A., Minneapolis, MN (June 2010 - August 2013) Senior Loan Account Representative. Managed accounts for 20 clients who maintained more than $10 million in commercial loan transactions. Analyzed and presented trends information to senior bank management. Researched and assessed the impact of new federal bank regulations on clients and on compliance activities of the bank. Southern Minnesota Regional Legal Services, Mankato, MN, May July 2014 Volunteer Law Clerk Researched tenant rights issues, including the right to cure, HUD Section 8 rules, giving proper notice before eviction and the landlord s duty to repair. Advised as many as 20 clients per day regarding legal housing issues. Advocated with HUD on behalf of four clients to resolve compliance issues. INTERESTS OR COMMUNITY SERVICE This section shows a sense of you as a person, in a way that will be likely to help you connect with a legal employer. TIPS: The Interests section is optional but can be more interesting by providing some details. For example: Traveled in East Asia vs. simply Travel. Publications, Language or Licenses/Certifications (CPA, Rule 114 neutral, etc.) could be additional headings that show specific skills. If you are active in professional organizations or have been published, you may also want to include those. SPECIAL TOPICS Certain topics are hot button topics those that may create a negative impression on the resume reviewer, based on the reviewer s own background and beliefs. These topics include politics, social fraternities, religion, sexual preferences, and issues that are currently being debated by society. There are three ways to handle these issues in a resume: 1) list the activities 2) list activities in a neutral way 3) or, do not include these on your resume. It is your choice whether or not to disclose activities or experiences that reflect your beliefs/values. These can be listed as follows: Minnesota Law Students for (Democrat/Republican) Candidate (Then list activities.) State Chairman, Law Student Organization, for presidential candidate (Then, list activities, as you choose.) SPECIAL RESUMES: OCI, Judicial Clerkship, IP and Public Interest Certain resumes require a different emphasis. Judicial Clerkship: Emphasize Moot Court, Judicial externships, Law Review, research and writing experiences, including any publications. On-Campus Interviews (OCI): Include your GPA, Class Rank, and (Top __%), Law Review, and all other academic achievements. Public Interest: Public interest employers are particularly interested in things that show a commitment to public service and connections to the greater community, particularly in the area dealt with by that employer. Include a separate section with volunteer work and community involvement. In the cover letter, you will also want to emphasize how and why your commitment to this kind of public interest opportunity arose. Intellectual Property (IP): IP employers are often looking for a specific technical background. List details about the technical aspects of your education and experience, including publications and research projects. These resumes can be longer than one page. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS: Can I use my nickname on my resume if that s what I prefer to be called? Use your full legal name and write your nickname in parentheses or quotation marks. (For example: Elizabeth Betsy Roberts). If your nickname doesn t seem professional, do not use it on your resume. Should I use an objectives statement? Most legal resumes do not include an objectives statement. Mention the position you are applying for (and why) in your cover letter. Should my resume be only one-page? Legal employers prefer to see a concise resume. Most law student resumes are one page. If you have extensive professional experience or a technical background it may be appropriate to have a two-page resume. If your resume is two pages, make sure that your name is on the second page (Robin Hood, page 2), but omit the complete header. How important is formatting? Make your resume inviting and easy to read by using white space wisely. Do not overuse bold, italics, or underlined text because it may make your resume appear busy. (For example: Bold the names of educational institutions and employers, but do not bold the city, state, and dates). Do I need to list my GPA and Class Rank? How do I explain if my grades are not in the top ___ % of my class? Most law firms want to see your GPA and class rank. Emphasize the positive. If your grades show an upward trend, show both cumulative GPA and the trend: Cumulative GPA: 2.9; GPA: 3.4 (second year). If you received a high grade in a class that pertains to the position, you may list it (this could also be highlighted in the cover letter as well.) Should I include my undergraduate activities and honors? Legal employers are typically most interested in your law school experience. Select the most relevant honors and activities. If you received a substantial scholarship related to your academic performance, you can say Presidential Scholarship or Academic scholarships How should I list clinics, competitions, and other experiences? List clinics, internships and competitions after you have been accepted or have started the experience. Do not list clinics or competitions you anticipate taking. If you want to emphasize courses relevant to the position, such as IP courses, you could include this in a sub-category Course Highlights in the Education section (in addition to your cover letter). Where do I list clinics and MJF experience? Clinic participation and volunteering with MJF are important legal experiences include these under the Legal Experience section to provide more visibility. What about Study Abroad? Study abroad can also set you apart from other students. You can add a Study Abroad section as an activity under the college or university you attended. EXAMPLE: Study Abroad: London, England (May-June 2015) Emphasis: Comparative Contracts and Alternative Dispute Resolution. If the study abroad was sponsored by another university, you may also list the name of that University. Do I need to list every job on my resume? List the jobs that are pertinent to the position. You do not need to list every single position. There should not, however, be large unexplained time gaps in your resume. What if I was promoted or had several jobs with one company? You can list the company information once, and then list each separate position with a description. See examples in the Legal Resume Samples found in the Symplicity Document Library. What if my only experience is non-legal? Describe your accomplishments and results. Employment at Starbucks during the rush hours says a lot about your ability to handle pressure and provide good customer service. Describe non-legal experiences focusing on transferable legal skills. We also recommend gaining legal experience through MJF, externships, or clinics to add legal experience to your resume. Should I list undergraduate internships? Some college internships provide excellent experience and make you stand out to an employer. These should be listed under activities. As a second career student, how do I describe my experience? Focus on your transferable skills, selecting the most relevant experiences. Be careful that your descriptions do not use jargons or acronyms that are unfamiliar to legal recruiters. Law School Resume Worksheet Use this worksheet to assist you in brainstorming all of the possible experiences to list on your resume. All resumes should have contact information, education and experience sections, but content will differ greatly, depending on your unique background. A resume is a targeted marketing piece about you, with the employer as your audience. Think about what you can do for the employer, with an emphasis on your skills and accomplishments, rather than on duties and responsibilities.

They are also your one chance to make a great first impression. The idea is to set yourself apart from the rest of the crowd, while still maintaining the traditional professionalism required in the field of law. Remember, the resume is not a complete autobiography! It is a prospectus for the future. Its main task is to convince prospective employers to contact you for an interview. A good resume should: o o o Be eye-appealing Highlight your significant accomplishments Be logically displayed for a 30-second (or less) review Identify Your Skills It is sometimes difficult to fully and effectively inventory and evaluate your own skills profile. Ask yourself: What special abilities have I developed which allowed me to perform successfully in my previous activities/jobs? Do not be concerned that you have little or no previous experience in legal jobs. Job skills are transferable. For example, the communications skills learned in a retail position will be useful in your future legal career when counseling clients. Categorize your skills as follows all three categories are important and highly valued by employers! o Technical/Professional Skills skills that are related to performing within a job and acquired by education, training, reading, and/or hands-on experiences (i.e., internships, clerkships, volunteer opportunities). These skills are often listed in advertised job postings: e.g., legal research abilities, writing skills, working knowledge of a certain area of law (e.g., Uniform Commercial Code). o Functional Skills skills related to people, information, and things that are transferable from one field to another (e.g., organization, communication, management, leadership). These abilities are easy to overlook or downplay, but are highly valued by prospective employers and crucial to successful workplace performance. o Personal/Adaptive Skills -- skills often referred to as personality and/or character traits (e.g., patience, decisiveness, team player, self-starter, quick learner, detail-oriented, work well under pressure). Inventorying your Experiences/Resume Content Heading (name, address, email, telephone) Education/Honors/School-Related Activities (reverse chronological order) o Education typically begins with college. o List degree/year obtained or expected; names and locations of schools. o Include your GPA if 3.0 or higher; class rank if in the top one-third Certificates/Licenses/Bar Admission(s) Professional/Work Experience Be specific! Include title, months and years of employment, name and location of employer. Instead of automatically listing job duties for each job, try to write accomplishment statementsthat single out and spotlight your major achievements. Accomplishment statements are far more compelling than a list of job duties and responsibilities. Think back on your previous positions and highlight any experiences that represent achievements. To pinpoint achievements, some people think in terms of baseball and ask, What were my triples and homeruns in that job?Once you identify the triples and homeruns, write out an explanation of what you did. For additional help on how to write accomplishment statements, go to www.careerlab.com/art_homeruns.htm. It may be helpful to describe each experience using a P-A-R (Problem-Action-Result) formula. Describe the Problem (or challenge/responsibility) you faced in the position, Action(s) you took to reach an objective/goal, and the Result or accomplishment. Contrast the effectiveness of these two statements: Basic/Generic Description Using P-A-R Formula Performed legal research and drafted a response to a motion for summary judgment Drafted successful opposition to pivotal motion for summary judgment in personal injury case involving more than $10 million in damages List job duties where accomplishment statements are not feasible. Obviously, no one hits triples and homeruns in every job. If you don have any significant achievements in a particular job, it is perfectly acceptable to list your job duties and responsibilities, but it need not be an exhaustive list. Stick to the more significant ones that will be meaningful to the reader. A list of sample phrases for job duties as well as accomplishment statements is included below. Use action verbs to start each statement and omit personal pronouns (i.e., I or my ). A list of action verbs is included below. Quantify number of people, products, profits involved (e.g., Supervised 15-20 community volunteers ). Volunteer, clinical, and/or internship experience This may be your strong point! Always consider how you can put your best foot forward , presenting yourself as an experienced, capable candidate. Professional Memberships/Activities/Publications Special skills (fluency in a foreign language; advanced computer skills if truly beyond those skills expected) Activities/Interests (extracurricular activites, hobbies, interesting pursuits) Format One page (unless you have significant work experience, e.g. career before law school, high level responsibility, etc.) Professional, clean, easy-to-read typeface Standard 12 pt. font Reasonable margins Printed on high quality paper (limit color to white, cream, pale gray) Use space to highlight information and make it easy to read Tips and Traps Tailor your resume to the specific employer o Be sure to include skills and experience sought by the employer Proofread (for accuracy, grammar, punctuation, and correct telephone number) No personal information! (i.e. marital status, children, etc.) Have two other people proofread (perfection is key) Before including anything on your resume, ask yourself this: Does this information significantly contribute to your presentation? If not, exclude it. Exclude photograph Make sure that your voice-mail message is appropriate Don t list references on your resume. Have a separate list available if requested. It is important to select people as references who are familiar with your work skills. Ask former employers or colleagues. Include their full names, job titles and addresses, along with phone numbers and email addresses.

{"index": "test", "type": "test", "id": 8040, "body": {"body": "Finance Killer Legal Resumes Resumes are an individual expression of who you are. They are also your one chance to make a great first impression. The idea is to set yourself apart from the rest of the crowd, while still maintaining the traditional professionalism required in the field of law. Remember, the resume is not a complete autobiography! It is a prospectus for the future. Its main task is to convince prospective employers to contact you for an interview. A good resume should: o o o Be eye-appealing Highlight your significant accomplishments Be logically displayed for a 30-second (or less) review Identify Your Skills It is sometimes difficult to fully and effectively inventory and evaluate your own skills profile. Ask yourself: What special abilities have I developed which allowed me to perform successfully in my previous activities/jobs? Do not be concerned that you have little or no previous experience in legal jobs. Job skills are transferable. For example, the communications skills learned in a retail position will be useful in your future legal career when counseling clients. Categorize your skills as follows all three categories are important and highly valued by employers! o Technical/Professional Skills skills that are related to performing within a job and acquired by education, training, reading, and/or hands-on experiences (i.e., internships, clerkships, volunteer opportunities). These skills are often listed in advertised job postings: e.g., legal research abilities, writing skills, working knowledge of a certain area of law (e.g., Uniform Commercial Code). o Functional Skills skills related to people, information, and things that are transferable from one field to another (e.g., organization, communication, management, leadership). These abilities are easy to overlook or downplay, but are highly valued by prospective employers and crucial to successful workplace performance. o Personal/Adaptive Skills -- skills often referred to as personality and/or character traits (e.g., patience, decisiveness, team player, self-starter, quick learner, detail-oriented, work well under pressure). Inventorying your Experiences/Resume Content Heading (name, address, email, telephone) Education/Honors/School-Related Activities (reverse chronological order) o Education typically begins with college. o List degree/year obtained or expected; names and locations of schools. o Include your GPA if 3.0 or higher; class rank if in the top one-third Certificates/Licenses/Bar Admission(s) Professional/Work Experience Be specific! Include title, months and years of employment, name and location of employer. Instead of automatically listing job duties for each job, try to write accomplishment statementsthat single out and spotlight your major achievements. Accomplishment statements are far more compelling than a list of job duties and responsibilities. Think back on your previous positions and highlight any experiences that represent achievements. To pinpoint achievements, some people think in terms of baseball and ask, What were my triples and homeruns in that job?Once you identify the triples and homeruns, write out an explanation of what you did. For additional help on how to write accomplishment statements, go to www.careerlab.com/art_homeruns.htm. It may be helpful to describe each experience using a P-A-R (Problem-Action-Result) formula. Describe the Problem (or challenge/responsibility) you faced in the position, Action(s) you took to reach an objective/goal, and the Result or accomplishment. Contrast the effectiveness of these two statements: Basic/Generic Description Using P-A-R Formula Performed legal research and drafted a response to a motion for summary judgment Drafted successful opposition to pivotal motion for summary judgment in personal injury case involving more than $10 million in damages List job duties where accomplishment statements are not feasible. Obviously, no one hits triples and homeruns in every job. If you don have any significant achievements in a particular job, it is perfectly acceptable to list your job duties and responsibilities, but it need not be an exhaustive list. Stick to the more significant ones that will be meaningful to the reader. A list of sample phrases for job duties as well as accomplishment statements is included below. Use action verbs to start each statement and omit personal pronouns (i.e., I or my ). A list of action verbs is included below. Quantify number of people, products, profits involved (e.g., Supervised 15-20 community volunteers ). Volunteer, clinical, and/or internship experience This may be your strong point! Always consider how you can put your best foot forward , presenting yourself as an experienced, capable candidate. Professional Memberships/Activities/Publications Special skills (fluency in a foreign language; advanced computer skills if truly beyond those skills expected) Activities/Interests (extracurricular activites, hobbies, interesting pursuits) Format One page (unless you have significant work experience, e.g. career before law school, high level responsibility, etc.) Professional, clean, easy-to-read typeface Standard 12 pt. font Reasonable margins Printed on high quality paper (limit color to white, cream, pale gray) Use space to highlight information and make it easy to read Tips and Traps Tailor your resume to the specific employer o Be sure to include skills and experience sought by the employer Proofread (for accuracy, grammar, punctuation, and correct telephone number) No personal information! (i.e. marital status, children, etc.) Have two other people proofread (perfection is key) Before including anything on your resume, ask yourself this: Does this information significantly contribute to your presentation? If not, exclude it. Exclude photograph Make sure that your voice-mail message is appropriate Don t list references on your resume. Have a separate list available if requested. It is important to select people as references who are familiar with your work skills. Ask former employers or colleagues. Include their full names, job titles and addresses, along with phone numbers and email addresses.

Use percentages to make your grades stand out, but order them carefully. If you end your list with your lowest grade, the reader may remember the 70% rather than the 80%. Use subheads and bullet points to make your CV easier to read. No more than two or three bullet points to explain what you got out of each experience and how you made an impact. Use strong, active verbs. Make sure it s not too prose heavy, suggests Anup Vithlani at Trowers & Hamlin. Note the reverse chronological order.

This section is your opportunity to illustrate your motivation for a career in law, with a particular type of firm. But don t go overboard about the skills you developed on your placement; you re also likely to have developed soft skills in extra-curricular activities, part-time work and in positions of responsibility. Use confident language to describe your parttime or holiday experience of retail or bar jobs. Make sure you mention any promotions.

Every recruiter knows you re going to provide references if they request it so there s no reason for you to include this line. Again, remember that space on your resume is crucial so don t waste it on a meaningless line, Separating your experience into different categories, such as legal, commercial and voluntary, makes it easier for the reader. Jessica warns against using subheads such as Relevant work experience ; it suggests that you think the rest of your CV is irrelevant. Quantify your major accomplishments and contributions for each role. This can include the money you saved or brought in for your employer, deals closed, and projects delivered on time or under budget. Do not use any more than three to five bullet points. Many companies use some kind of screening process to identify the right candidates. You should include the keywords mentioned in the job posting throughout your resume. Identify the common keywords, terminology, and key phrases that routinely pop up in the job descriptions of your target role and incorporate them into your resume (assuming you have those skills) Don t list achievements in dense blocks of text. Recruiters receive so many resumes to scan through at a time, so make it as easy as possible for them to understand why you re perfect for the job. Dense blocks of text are too difficult to read. Ask as many friends and family to proofread your application as necessary; there s no room for typos in an application to a law firm you re trying to convince people of your attention to detail. Using the verb advise rather than the noun advice could jeopardise your chances of an interview. All lawyers need excellent drafting skills and attention to detail. Include any personal impact you had in a role or position and quantify your impact where possible. If you proposed a new idea, explain briefly what it was and whether it was implemented. As Harvey pointed out, took team from 14th to 4th rank at national university league level shows the personal impact this person has had on the team Try not to lose momentum towards the end of the CV. This section helps the recruiter build up a picture of what makes you tick. You could pull out various tasks here but think about what lawyers do: they pitch for new work and have to meet regular deadlines, under pressure. White space draws the reader s eyes to important points. Recruiters do not spend a lot of time scanning resumes, so avoid dense blocks of text. The key is to format the information in a way that makes it easy to scan and recognise your job goals and relevant qualifications. Don t use headers or footers. It may look neat and concise to display your contact information in the header, but for the same reason with embedded tables and charts, it often gets scrambled in an applicant tracking system Annotated Sample CV for Australian Law Students, Graduates and Young Lawyers Beyond Law 2014.

He began his career as a lawyer with the Community Legal Services Program, a law office sponsored by The University Of Texas School Of Law. When the program was absorbed by the Travis County Legal Aid and Defender Society in 1972, he became a Legal Aid lawyer. In both these positions he supervised law students in one of the Law School s earliest clinical programs, what today is called an externship. In 1975, Mr. Allison was recruited to be a full time Lecturer at the UT School Of Law, teaching and supervising students in the newly formed Criminal Defense Clinic (CDC). The CDC was the Law School s first true clinic with an academic component. In 1977, Mr. Allison and a student attorney appealed one of the Clinic s early cases, a free speech case, to the United States Supreme Court and won. Also in 1977, Mr. Allison opened his first private practice in Austin, concentrating on federal and state criminal defense, while remaining on the faculty half-time as a Lecturer to continue teaching and supervising CDC students. He began teaching trial advocacy for the National Institute for Trial Advocacy in 1978 and has taught more than fifty, one- to threeweek trial advocacy courses for lawyers and for law students at various venues around the nation. In Fall 1995, Mr. Allison was invited to teach a seminar entitled, Franz Kafka and the Systems of Punishment in the Plan II Honors program at UT. He taught that course through the fall semester of 2002, then turned the course over to the Hon. Robert Pitman, a UT Law School and CDC graduate, and now a United States Magistrate for the Western District of Texas. Mr. Allison retired from the la w school faulty after the summer semester, 2002, and has devoted himself to his private practice. In January 2004, Mr. Allison returned to teaching full time as a Clinical Professor of Law and Director of the Criminal Defense Clinic. From 1993 to 1999, Mr. Allison served as Editor-in-Chief of Voice for the Defense, the monthly magazine of the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association. He is recognized in The Best Lawyers in America. In June, 2001, he was named Best Defense Lawyer of the Year for 20002001, by the Criminal Justice Section of the State Bar of Texas. In November 2003, Texas Monthly Magazine named him one of the Super Lawyers of Texas (a peer reviewed award) and one of the top fifty (50) lawyers for Central and West Texas. He has been listed in Woodward & White s Best Lawyers in America since 1996, and has been A/V rated by Martindale -Hubble for over twenty years. In recent years, Mr. Allison has worked to obtain the exoneration of innocent individuals who have been wrongfully convic ted, cases of actual innocence. He and a team of lawyers recently won the release of a young man who had spent more than 12 years in prison for a murder he did not commit. Mr. Allison also won the exoneration for another innocent man who had spent 16 years in prison for a sexual assault he did not commit. Recently, he was part of the team that won a $5.3 million civil rights settlement for one of these exonerated individuals. He has just achieved the commutation of a death penalty case in Texas for a mentally retarded man. This was a court appointed case on which he worked for over six years. In the Fall of 2003, along with David Sheppard and Prof. Robert Dawson, Mr. Allison incorporated the Texas Center for Actual Innocence as a Section 501 (c) (3) tax-exempt, non- 1 profit corporation to find and assist actually innocent inmates who are serving long-term or death penalty sentences. Through the generous cooperation of the UT School Of Law and the Austin law firm of Graves Daugherty Hearon and Moody, the Center has prepared a syllabus, written a manual, recruited an initial class of ten students out of fifty applicants, and screened the first inmate requests. This hybrid class is privately funded, with little or no cost to the law school. CURRENT Principal, Law Office of William P. Allison, Austin, Texas.

{"index": "test", "type": "test", "id": 8460, "body": {"body": "Finance 19 Legal CVs Guidelines Clear headings with different text size help the reader find the information they want. Fancy styles and fonts are better suited to CVs for creative jobs A two page CV is normally expected. Early in your degree when you have limited experience, you might want to use a single-sided CV for speculative applications Putting your name in a footnote can help avoiding the pages getting separated when the employer prints it out. If printing yourself, use good quality white or cream paper Law firms will expect your applications to be error free. Spell-check helps but don t rely on it and pay attention to punctuation and appropriate use of capital letters. It s hard to pick up your own errors, so try asking a friend to proof read for you Recruiters like to find dates easily. One way is to put dates at the left margin, followed by the name of the employer or place of study and job title or qualification obtained. Try to do this across a single line Style guides can ensure consistency of headings and accurate alignment of text but avoid standardised CV templates which reduce the individuality of your document Think what recruiters most want to know about you. Give most space and prominence to the qualifications and experience that are most relevant. You can find out what some of the leading legal recruiters are looking for at http://targetjobs.co.uk/career-sectors/lawsolicitors/applications-and-interviews/skills-graduate-recruiters-at-law-firms-lo. LawCareers.net has similar information at www.lawcareers.net/Information/Features/Detail.aspx?r=1269 Try to show that you can make a positive difference by concentrating on significant outcomes from work experience and interests rather than listing everything you ve done Try to describe your skills in a way that is appropriate for a particular application. For example, all lawyers need strong communication skills but the people you meet as a City lawyer are different from the clients in high street practice, so select relevant examples from your own communication experience It is vital you check everything you have written as even the tiniest of errors will probably mean your application is rejected. You d kick yourself if all the hours spent on your CV content are wasted. A structure that suits most applications Title. Putting Curriculum Vitae is old-fashioned, so use your first and last names as the title. If your first name could also be a last name, try putting your last name in bold or a larger font. Personal details. You don t need to use the heading Personal details but you normally include address (and contact address if different); phone number(s) and email address(es) but make sure they are up to date. Nationality is optional but it is good to show that you have permission to work in the UK if you are not an EEA or British national. If your gender is not obvious from your name, you might wish to include it so that recruiters know how to address correspondence to you or put in your title (Mr/Ms etc) to make it clear. Make sure this section looks professional by avoiding email addresses that say too much about your personal life! The Kent careers website gives examples of some addresses which might give recruiters the wrong impression! www.kent.ac.uk/careers/cv.htm Personal profile/career objective. A personal profile can work well if you have something very specific that you want to highlight but recruiters don t like profiles such as highly motivated, ambitious law student with excellent communication and team working skills that look like everyone else s and provide no evidence of the skills you claim to have. The sort that might work is Multilingual LLM student with a 1st at undergraduate level and six months international legal experience .. in a single sentence this emphasises five things that could interest employers ie languages, study at Master s level, excellent academic results, significant work experience and an international perspective. A career objective might be similar but also mention what you are looking for eg seeking experience in banking law. It is hard to write the kind of profile which will really make you stand out. Education. This could also be entitled Education and qualifications or Education and awards. It s usual to list qualifications in reverse chronological order, stating degree modules and grades as well as A level and GCSE grades. Mention your dissertation either for the relevance of the content to the firm or for the research, analytical and organisational skills it developed. Use columns and list A levels or GCSEs in as few lines as possible to save space. You don t need to name every GCSE subject but recruiters will be interested in number of A*, A and B grades and you could mention grades (if good) for core subjects such as English, maths and modern languages. Include any major academic prizes you won in school, college or university. Include academic qualifications only; other qualifications such as IT skills certificates could go into a skills section if relevant. Legal experience. List in reverse chronological order and include voluntary work. You can include attendance at open days and activities like the TARGETchances events as well as work experience. Emphasise your most significant achievements, knowledge gained and skills learned rather than listing every single thing you have done and give the most space to significant responsibilities. Use bullet points, be concise and avoid repetition if you have done the same work on several occasions. Other work experience. You may have non-legal experience that is particularly relevant to your legal applications. Examples include commercial experience for commercial law or welfare/advisory work for legal aid or public sector practice. If so, you could make this a separate section. Avoid detailed descriptions of everything you did in casual jobs, but give a brief overview, information on any unusual achievements, such as rapid promotion or extra responsibility, and describe transferable skills. While bar work might not seem very relevant, successfully handling awkward customers will probably have developed your ability to defuse most difficult situations. Skills. Most of your skills will be evident in your descriptions of work experience and extracurricular activities, but you might have a short section detailing skills such as IT competence, languages and driving licence. Different firms will be interested in different languages; those doing multinational business normally like European languages and those relating to other countries in which they operate, whereas an immigration practice will welcome languages that are relevant to their clients. Interests and achievements. Use a heading that emphasises your particular strengths such as positions of responsibility or voluntary work. Think what your activities say about you bigger firms of solicitors like sports, other team activities and evidence of outstanding achievement. Aim to show yourself as a rounded and interesting person who can manage your time well enough to combine getting a good degree with extra curricular activities. But if you have had to work long hours in a part-time job during your degree and this has limited your time for hobbies, don t be afraid to mention this under work experience you could just indicate the number of hours you work in an average week CV examples Look at the CV examples and sample covering letters but don t be tempted to simply copy either style or content.

The concept, sold as Metaxerol , (U.S. Patent #5,660,852; coinventor) was taken from idea to market profit in two years. Completely computerized all diets at the zoos in Denver, San Antonio, Tyler (Tx), Tucson and New Orleans Isomeric forms of vitamin E vary in bioavailability. As a leading proponent of the application of this insight, birth of endangered exotic species occurred at New Orleans (Gorilla and Orangutan, 1996), and Tyler, Texas (Black Rhino, 1993) and African elephant pregnancy confirmed (10/97) at Great Adventure Safari, New Jersey.

But one resume does not fit all. This article offers tips and suggestions on how to weave your specialized areas of practice into your resume and make sure it is tailored to fit your career path. The American Dietetic Association offers several resources for those pursuing new employment, including networking opportunities on the local and national level, ADACareerLink, and Job Descriptions: Models for Careers in Dietetics, now in its second edition and full of job description models for RDs in clinical, business and consultation, research, management, and public health. Also, see Getting that First Job: Search and Resume Tips from the September 2006 issue of the Journal for sample resumes for a first-time job seeker and an RD with managementlevel experience. Experts interviewed for this article stress the importance of using such resources in addition to perfecting the resume. However, the resume is often what gets an applicant s foot in the door. Many people still get caught in the This article was written by Jennifer Mathieu, a freelance writer in Houston, TX. Mathieu is a former editorial assistant for the Journal and has journalism degree from Northwestern University. Mathieu s writing has appeared in The Washington Post, Houston Chronicle, Miami Herald, The Kansas City Star, and several other publications. While reporting for the Houston Press, she received awards from the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies, the Dallas Press Club, the State Bar of Texas, and the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. doi: 10.1016/j.jada.2010.01.004 trap of writing one resume and sending the same one out to all potential employers, says Susan Laramee, MS, RD, LDN, FADA, manager of clinical recruitment for Sodexo, Inc (Gaithersburg, MD). Many resumes are very generic. If you don t address the skills the hiring manager is seeking, it is unlikely that you will be invited for an interview. Laramee finds the traditional practice of listing an objective to be unnecessary but does believe it s important that credentials and contact information are at the top of the resume and easy to spot. Because many jobs now require applicants to apply online, Laramee says it is key to make sure your e-mail address is accurate and is hyperlinked, providing for easy use. Some of the stronger resumes Laramee has seen when recruiting for management positions have been those that have a bulleted summary of skills at the top of a resume, for example, In-depth comprehension of principles of nutrition, Demonstrated capability in customer service, and Flexibility to work alone or as a team member (see Figure 1). BE SPECIFIC Job candidates should use strong verbs like generate, implement, enhance, and improve, says Laramee. In addition to action verbs, specificity in language is also necessary, especially when tailoring your resume as all mid-career RD should do, say those interviewed for this article. Mary Jane Rogalski, MBA, RD, LDN, manager of clinical nutrition at Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, MA, and the chair of the Clinical Nutrition Management dietetic practice group, looks for details that paint a clear picture of an RD s previous employment. Words like, assessed patient needs won t do much to describe the type of patient or the type of facility, says Rogalski. In a clinical resume, I expect to see words that describe involvement with high nutrition risk patients, like 2010 by the American Dietetic Association percentage tube feeding or percentage total parenteral nutrition. There needs to be a heavier emphasis on diagnostic skills (see Figure 1). Clinicians in the inpatient environment should specify whether they have worked in a trauma center, teaching hospital, or community hospital as the level of patient nutrition acuity will vary by the type of institution, says Rogalski. And clinicians in the outpatient environment would be wise to include specific counseling skills, such as motivational interviewing, when working with clients outside the hospital environment. Of course, specificity is not limited to clinical dietitians resumes. Public health and community dietitians would want to provide specific demographics about the communities they have served in the past along with measurable achievements in those communities. A public health nutritionist would also want to include his or her knowledge and experience with population-based nutrition interventions, community organizing and mobilizing, breastfeeding education and promotion, and familiarity with government-sponsored programs such as WIC (Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children). An RD working in a school environment would need to list experience and familiarity with federal and state nutrition standards such as those set by the National School Lunch Program. School-based dietitians would also need to address potential responsibilities including participating in quality initiatives and gathering and analyzing data to evaluate and improve outcomes, developing and coordinating the efforts of the foodservice staff in order to promote nutrition and healthy eating, and analyzing menus and recipes for nutritional adequacy. An RD working with information technology and developing health technologies would want to showcase his or her experience working with data management systems or knowledge of laws and regulations protecting health data security and privacy (Figure 2).

Sample resume: Culinary nutrition consultant. March 2010 Journal of the AMERICAN DIETETIC ASSOCIATION 357 BUSINESS OF DIETETICS RDs applying for positions in consultation and business, such as corporate dietitians, food and nutrition policy consultants (Figure 3), and culinary nutrition consultants (Figure 4), would also want so show off a certain set of skills. A corporate dietitian may want to specify media events in which he or she served as a corporate spokesperson; a history of attending trade shows, conferences, and professional meetings; and brochures, Web sites, and promotional materials he or she helped create. A food and nutrition policy consultant would most likely want to include years of experience educating and lobbying members of Congress on nutrition topics, familiarity with legislation and regulation that impact the nutrition industry, and experience consulting with clients to develop targeted messages and responses to policies and regulations. A culinary nutrition consultant whose primary responsibilities might include writing and editing cookbooks, public speaking, and offering personal chef services would want to provide a publishing and 358 March 2010 Volume 110 Number 3 editing history, locations and class sizes of nutrition-based cooking classes and food demonstrations, and an understanding of Joint Commission and food safety standards. Laramee also suggests that for midcareer RDs, each previous place of employment include fewer bullets of information, and RDs with many years of experience can probably omit entry-level positions or simply list them without providing additional details. While many RDs with lengthy careers need more than one page, a resume should never be more than two pages, Laramee advises. The resume itself shows your skills and qualifications in the way it s organized and displayed, she says. If you put too much irrelevant information in your resume, you re showing that you lack focus or have difficulty with decisions, and your resume will lack clarity. INCLUDE RELEVANT INFORMATION As for education and work history, Laramee advises that RDs include only relevant material. Information about a high school diploma and courses taken in college are generally irrelevant. Be prepared to briefly and clearly explain any gaps in work history, and if rereentering the workforce after time off for family issues, be prepared to discuss how you have maintained your skills and kept up to date with new information during that gap. RDs with extensive careers may want to skip dates that reveal age, such as the year a bachelor s degree was earned, says Laramee. Simply listing the university and degree obtained is sufficient. While certifications, registrations, professional involvement, and awards specific to the field are all important to include, outside activities or positions outside of dietetics should not be included unless they can somehow be tailored to fit the position applied for. I had one applicant who included information on her first career as a florist because she was able to discuss the customer service skills she had as a small business owner, says Rogalski. Those skills could be connected to the patient service skills she was going to have to take on.

(Note: Most curriculum vitas are two to three pages in length depending on experience. This sample has omitted some details for length.) March 2010 Journal of the AMERICAN DIETETIC ASSOCIATION 359 BUSINESS OF DIETETICS THE CV According to Jeanene Fogli, PhD, RD, chair of the Research dietetic practice group, it s important to note that the research and education field may require a different type of resume a curriculum vitae (known as a CV) when applying for jobs. Whether applying to academic positions or for-profit research positions (such as working for a pharmaceutical company), interested applicants will most likely create a CV. Fogli, a director of medical and scientific affairs for i3 Research (Basking Ridge, NJ), says a CV will include educational and professional experience, but unlike a resume will also include a publishing history and a list of editorial boards the applicant is a member of (see Figure 5 for a sample CV). A publication history is key, says Fogli. If you are applying to a for-profit company, they want to sell your expertise, and a publishing history is part of that. Fogli adds that all applicants for research positions should include details on any exposure to clinical research and highlight any additional coursework in the sciences. A strong research dietitian s CV will also specify experience with regulatory filings for agencies like the Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency as well as familiarity with commonly used standardized research measures such as the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute s iliac waist measurement. Fogli adds that potential employers are looking for future employees who will not need to be trained in specific differences between a phase I and phase III trial and who will not need to be educated in the use of common measurements. Applicants should also include any funding they have received, such as listing a percentage of salary support for a particular study and identifying the funder. (For example, a CV may state 40% salary support for a study on the effect of jelly beans on the diet with funding coming from The National Jelly Bean Board.) According to Fogli, there is not one set standard for where in the CV this information should be included although it should appear prominently. You are expected to bring in research dollars, says Fogli. If you have a history of doing that, that s a bonus, so include it. 360 March 2010 Volume 110 Number 3 ONLINE RESUMES Many of the popular job and professional networking sites, such as Monster, Hot Jobs, or LinkedIn, as well as other niche Web sites or services like ADACareerLink, have you create a profile where you can upload a resume, or several, or have you create a resume using their resume form. Some job sites let you apply for positions by simply submitting your profile information. In these instances, you should edit your profile so that it specifically reflects the job for which you are posting. However, most job sites either provide contact information with an e-mail address where you should send your resume or provide a link directly to the employers Web site where contact information is provided or you have to fill out an online form. In these cases, it s a good idea to create your resume in several formats: a print version, a scannable version, and a plain text version. A print version can contain italicized or underlined text, different fonts and sizes, bulleted lists, and other design elements. This copy should be used hand to contacts and interviewers or sent via mail. A scannable version, to send as an e-mail attachment or upload as a file to a Web site, should contain limited design elements as it is first viewed by a computer and then uploaded to a database where employers can search resumes based on keywords. Design elements and text formatting can interfere with the scan. For scannable resumes, use one common font (such as Times New Roman) throughout (1). Instead of increasing the size of the font, use spacing to break up sections (1). Also, avoid using bullets, tables, and visuals in a scannable resume; instead, use dashes, left-justified text, and simple spacing (1). A plain text version, or text-only copy, is a version you should have available to cut and paste into online forms or the body of an email. As the name implies a plain text version contains no design elements. Whichever format is used, you want to create a resume specifically for the job you are applying for. Also, remember to update all the versions of your resume; otherwise, you may update your print version and accidently send out a scannable version that wasn t updated. ADAPT Fogli adds that positions that include presenting to clients research or otherwise may require the applicant to supply a video of such a presentation, so the hiring company can see performance in action. One of the biggest mistakes applicants make is not finding out more about the position and its requirements beforehand and not tailoring their resume to the job, says Laramee.
